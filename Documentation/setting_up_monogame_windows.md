This section will help you setup MonoGame on Windows.

### Developing MonoGame Applications

You will need an IDE to develop MonoGame applications, the most common on Windows is Visual Studio.
* Go to the [Visual Studio website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
* Download a Visual Studio IDE, the Community edition is free for personal use.
* Run the installer and complete the installation.

Visual Studio is an IDE used to develop applications in, among other languages, C#. C# is the most common language used in MonoGame development.

After installing Visual Studio, do the following:
* Go to [MonoGame Downloads page](http://www.monogame.net/downloads/)
* Click on the newest MonoGame release
* Download MonoGame for Visual Studio
* Run the installer
  * You will probably get an error from Windows Defender due to the install file not being digitally signed. If you do, click "More info" and then "Run anyway" to continue the installation.
* That's it, MonoGame is installed.

You are now ready to develop MonoGame applications using Visual Studio. The next time you open Visual Studio you will find a list of MonoGame template projects ready to use.
