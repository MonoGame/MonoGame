# Creating your First 2D Space Shooter Game
In this tutorial you will go through creating your first MonoGame project, a top down space shooter game from scratch to delivery.

This tutorial will cover the following topics:
* Creating objects and compartmentalize them into separate .cs files
* Player Input and Keyboard controls
* Spawning new objects objects at runtime such as enemies and bullets
* Adding collisions to objects
* Package and Delivery

At the end of this tutorial series you will have a working MonoGame project that you can share with your friends.

## Getting Started
If you are just getting started with MonoGame, follow the [Getting Started](~/articles/getting_started/0_getting_started.md) guide where you can understand the basics and set up your development environment. This tutorial series assumes you can add content to your game, setup an empty Monogame project, and have a decent understanding of C#.

This tutorial will be using Visual Studio 2022 for some references, but any development environment using the Monogame templates will work.

Create a new project using the MonoGame Cross-Platform Desktop Application templates:

Once you have an empty project ready to go, move on to the next part: [Part 1: Creating the GameManager Class](~/articles/tutorials/1_creating_gamemanager_class.md)
