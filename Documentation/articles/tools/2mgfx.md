# MGFXC

The MGFXC tool is used to compile [DirectX Effect files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d9/writing-an-effect)
for usage with MonoGame.

The MGCB Editor uses MGFXC to compile effects and wraps them in an xnb file so they can be loaded using `ContentManager`.
If you compile effects directly with MGFXC you can load effects using the `Microsoft.Framework.Xna.Graphics.Effect` constructor
that takes a byte array with the effect code. Effects compiled directly are not xnb files and can not be loaded by `ContentManager`.

## Installation

MGFXC can be installed as a [.NET Core tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools).
Make sure you have the .NET Core SDK installed. You can download it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

In a terminal run `dotnet tool install -g dotnet-mgfxc` to install MGFXC.

## Command Line

The command line options are:

```bat
mgfxc <SourceFile> <OutputFile> [/Debug] [/Profile:<DirectX_11,OpenGL,PlayStation4>]
```

### Source File

The input effect file in typical FX format with samplers, techniques, and passes defined.  This parameter is required.

### Output File

The path to write the compiled effect to.  This parameter is required.

NOTE: The generated file is not an XNB file for use with the ContentManager.

If the `/Debug` flag is passed the resulting compiled effect file will contain extra debug information and the fewest possible optimizations.

### Platform Profile

The `/Profile` option defines the platform we're targeting with this effect file.  It can be one of the following:

- DirectX_11
- OpenGL
- PlayStation4
- PSVita
- XboxOne
- Switch

NOTE: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PS Vita, and Switch support is only available to licensed console developers.

### Help

If you use `/?`, `/help`, or simply pass no parameters to MGFXC you will get information about these command line options.

## Runtime Use

The resulting compiled effect file can be used from your game code like so:

```csharp
byte[] bytecode = File.ReadAllBytes("mycompiled.mgfx");
var effect = new Effect(bytecode);
```

This is how the stock effects (BasicEffect, DualTextureEffect, etc) are compiled and loaded.
