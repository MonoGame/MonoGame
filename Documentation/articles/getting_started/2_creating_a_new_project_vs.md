Next type in the name that you wish to give your project, for this tutorial let's just use **Pong** (*note* you should not use spaces when naming the project). After you've entered the name, click on the **...** button next to the location text field, and select where you wish to save your project. Finally click **OK** to create a new project.

If everything went correctly, you should see an **Pong** project open up like in the picture below. To run your game simply press the big **Play Button** in the toolbar or press **F5**.
