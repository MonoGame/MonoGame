On the following dialog, type in the name that you wish to give your project, for this tutorial let's just use **Pong** (*note* you should not use spaces when naming the project). After you've entered the name, click on the **Browse** button next to the location text field, and select where you wish to save your project. Finally, click **Create** to create a new project.
