Now you should see a "New Project" dialog pop up, from here select **Templates > Visual C# > MonoGame** category, and then select **MonoGame Cross Platform Desktop Project**. Next type in the name that you wish to give your project, for this tutorial let's just use **ExampleGame** (do note that you should not use space character for it). After you've entered the name, click on the **Browse** button next to the location text field, and select where you wish to save your project. Finally click **OK** to create a new project.

If everything went correctly, you should see an **ExampleGame** project open up like in the picture bellow. To run your game simply press the big **Play Button** in the toolbar or press **F5**.
