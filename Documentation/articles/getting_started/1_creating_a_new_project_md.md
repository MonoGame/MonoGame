On the following dialog, type in the name that you wish to give your project. Do note that you should not use space character for it. For this tutorial, it will be named **ExampleGame**. After you've entered the name, click on the **Browse** button next to location text field, and select where you wish to save your project. Finally click **Create** to create a new project.
