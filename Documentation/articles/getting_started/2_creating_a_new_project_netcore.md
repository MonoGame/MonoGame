# .NET Core CLI

This guide will walk you through building a starter game with MonoGame using only the command line/terminal on your operating system and a lightweight coding tool of your choice (such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Create a MonoGame Project

You can now create new MonoGame projects. To do that:

- Create a new directory for your project.

- Open a new terminal window or command prompt and navigate to your project directory.

- Run `dotnet new <TemplateID> -o <ProjectName>` to create your project, where `<TemplateID>` is a platform identifier, and `<ProjectName>` the name of your project.

For example:

```
dotnet new mgdesktopgl -o MyGame
```

> To know which platform identifier (short name) to use for your project, please refer to [Target Platforms](~/articles/platforms/0_platforms.md), or type the following command into the command prompt to list the installed templates and their corresponding short names:
> 
> ```
> dotnet new -l
> ```

Once created, you can open your code editor of choice in the new folder and begin editing.

> To run your project, check the instructions for [packaging your game](~/articles/packaging_games.md) to build the executable using the .NET tooling.
