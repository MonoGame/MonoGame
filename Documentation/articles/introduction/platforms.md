# Target Platforms

MonoGame supports the following systems:

- Windows
- Mac
- Linux
- Android
- iOS
- PlayStation 4
- PlayStation Vita
- Xbox One
- Nintendo Switch
- Google Stadia

There are different implementations of MonoGame that we call target platforms (or just platforms).
The platforms mostly correspond to the systems MonoGame supports but some platforms support multiple systems. Platforms for systems that require registration such as PlayStation and Xbox are not publicly available. To get access to those platforms, please contact your console account manager(s). MonoGame documentation for closed platforms is available in their respective repositories.

Below is a list of public platforms with the corresponding NuGet package, the `dotnet new` template identifier and an explanation of the platform.

- [WindowsDX](#windowsdx)
- [DesktopGL](#desktopgl)
- [Windows Universal](#windowsuniversal)
- [Android](#android)
- [iOS](#ios)

## WindowsDX

**Supported Systems**: Windows
**NuGet Package**: MonoGame.Framework.WindowsDX
**Template ID**: mgwindowsdx

WindowsDX uses WinForms to manage the game window, DirectX (9.0c or newer) is used for graphics, and XAudio is used for audio. You can target Windows Vista and up with this platform.

## DesktopGL

**Supported Systems**: Windows, macOS, Linux
**NuGet Package**: MonoGame.Framework.DesktopGL
**Template ID**: mgdesktopgl

DesktopGL uses SDL for windowing. OpenGL is used for graphics, and OpenAL-Soft for audio. DesktopGL supports Windows (Vista and up), macOS (High Sierra 10.13 and up) and Linux (64bit-only).

DesktopGL requires at least OpenGL 2.0 with the ARB_framebuffer_object extension (or alternatively at least OpenGL 3.0).

DesktopGL is a convenient way to publish builds for Windows, macOS, and Linux from a single project and source code. It also allows to cross-compile any build from any of these operating systems.

DesktopGL currently does not have a `VideoPlayer` implementation.

## WindowsUniversal

**Supported Systems**: Windows 10, Xbox One (UWP-only, not XDK)
**NuGet Package**: MonoGame.Framework.WindowsUniversal
**Template ID**: mguwpcore, mguwpxaml

The WindowsUniversal platform runs on [Universal Windows Platform (UWP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide).
WindowsUniversal uses DirectX for graphics, and XAudio for audio just like the WindowsDX platform.

This platform is meant to publish games on the Windows Store, for both Windows and Xbox One (through the [Xbox Live Creators Program](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/developers/creators-program)).

Note that UWP games running on Xbox One get [restricted access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/xbox-apps/system-resource-allocation) to the console capabilities. To unlock those restrictions, MonoGame has a dedicated Xbox One platform for registered [ID@Xbox](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/Developers/id) developers targeting the XDK (this platform is private and requires you to contact your ID@Xbox manager).

## Android

**Supported Systems**: Android
**NuGet Package**: MonoGame.Framework.Android
**Template ID**: mgandroid

The Android platform uses [Xamarin.Android](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/android/).
OpenGL is used for graphics, and OpenAL for audio.

## iOS

**Supported Systems**: iOS
**NuGet Package**: MonoGame.Framework.iOS
**Template ID**: mgios

The iOS platform uses [Xamarin.iOS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/).
OpenGL is used for graphics, and OpenAL for audio.
