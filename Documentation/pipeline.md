  * Import existing .contentproj.
  * Tree view showing content of project.
  * Property grid for editing content settings.
  * Full undo/redo support.
  * Build, rebuild, and clean the project.
  * Rebuild selected items.
  * Create new content like fonts and xml.
  * Support for custom importers/processors/writers.
  * Template format for adding new custom content types.

Currently the Pipeline Tool is only available on Windows and is part of the SDK installation.  The Mac and Linux versions are in development and should be available soon.
