Now you should see a "New Project" dialog pop up, from here select **Templates > Visual C# > MonoGame** category, and then select **MonoGame Cross Platform Desktop Project**.

After you've entered the name, click on the **Browse** button next to the location text field, and select where you wish to save your project. Finally click **OK** to create a new project.
