# Welcome to the MonoGame game library documentation hub

This area of the site contains the documentation on the API of MonoGame as well as how to use it to create great games.

MonoGame is an open source implementation of the Microsoft XNA 4 Framework. Our goal is to allow people to make great games using a simple API.

If you cannot find what you need here you can also look at the [Microsoft XNA documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb200104.aspx). MonoGame is API compatible
with XNA even down to the namespaces. So usually what works for XNA will work for MonoGame too.

The documentation site is made up of several major parts which are available as links at the top of the page.

## We Need Your Help!

Truly great open source projects require high-quality documentation.  This is a call for volunteers to help us make the MonoGame documentation truly great.  If you can help write tutorials, guides, code snippets, reference docs, video walkthroughs or just any improvement to our current documentation we could use your help!

Check out the [README on GitHub](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/blob/develop/README.md) or [talk with us on the community site](http://community.monogame.net/t/lets-improve-the-monogame-documentation/916) to learn how to help!
