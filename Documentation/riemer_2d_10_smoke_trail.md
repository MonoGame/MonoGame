## Adding the smoke trail
This chapter will be pretty straightforward if you've been following allow the way, so it makes a nice exercise to practice a bit. The idea is simple enough: for each position of the rocket, we will add a small smoke image.

Start by downloading the smoke image [by clicking here](http://www.riemers.net/Downloads/resources/Series2D/smoke.png) and importing it into our XNA project. Add the corresponding variable at the top of our code:

    Texture2D smokeTexture;

And initialize it in our LoadContent method:

    smokeTexture = Content.Load<Texture2D> ("smoke");

There's one thing that makes the task a bit difficult: we don't know exactly how many smoke particles we'll need, so we don't know how many positions we need to store. But that's easily solved by using a default .NET feature: the List. A List is a collection of which you don't need to specify its size: just add or remove items to/from it when you want. So add this variable to the top of our code:

    List<Vector2> smokeList = new List<Vector2> ();
    Random randomizer = new Random();

We specify this List will be used to store Vector2 objects. We're already initializing it as an empty List. The second variable we're adding is very useful in game programming: it will generate random numbers whenever we ask it to. We can already use some random numbers in this chapter, as we will add a small random deviation to the position of the smoke particles.

This allows us to move to our UpdateRocket method. This is an ideal spot to store a position in our List, as this method is called 60 times each second. Add this code to the end of the if-block in the UpdateRocket method:

    Vector2 smokePos = rocketPosition;
    smokePos.X += randomizer.Next(10) - 5;
    smokePos.Y += randomizer.Next(10) - 5;
    smokeList.Add(smokePos);

This retrieves the current position of the rocket, and adds a random component to both the X and Y coordinates. The randomizer is asked for a random number between 0 and 10, from which we subtract 5, resulting in a random number between -5 and 5. The resulting position is stored in our smokeList!

All we need to do now, is draw the smoke image at each position stored in the smokeList. To this end, we will code a new, easy method, DrawSmoke:

    private void DrawSmoke()
    {
        foreach (Vector2 smokePos in smokeList)
            spriteBatch.Draw(smokeTexture, smokePos, null, Color.White, 0, new Vector2(40, 35), 0.2f, SpriteEffects.None, 1);
    }

For each position stored in the smokeList, we draw a smokeTexture. Since we're not adjusting any of the stuff inside the List, we can use a foreach-loop instead of a for-loop.

Don't forget to call this method from inside our Draw method:

    DrawSmoke();

Now try to run this code! When you fire a rocket, you should see a fine trail of smoke behind our rocket. We want some more smoke, so instead of adding just one particle at a time, we'll add 5: in our UpdateRocket method:

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        Vector2 smokePos = rocketPosition;
        smokePos.X += randomizer.Next(10) - 5;
        smokePos.Y += randomizer.Next(10) - 5;
        smokeList.Add(smokePos);
    }

That's it for this chapter!
