This section will help you setup MonoGame on Mac OSX.

### Running MonoGame Applications


### Developing MonoGame Applications

Developing on the Mac requires a number of other frameworks and applications.
To get started you can use the Linux or DesktopGL platforms which will run quite happily
on MacOS providing you have mono installed.

So to get setup you will first need to install mono. 
* Go to [Mono Downloads page](http://www.mono-project.com/download/)
* Download the latest Mac OS installer.

Note: If you are running El Capitan you will need to install the very latest mono otherwise things 
will not work correctly.

You will also need Visual Studio for Mac
* Go to the [Visual Studio for Mac website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/)
* Download the installer.

This will install Visual Studio for Mac (which is free).

To setup MonoGame application development on mac OSX do the following:
* Go to [MonoGame Downloads page](http://www.monogame.net/downloads/)
* Click on the newest MonoGame release
* Download MonoGame for Mac
* Open the .pkg 
  * You will probably get an error about signing. If you do , right click and Open the .pkg file and you will be able to continue
* That's it, MonoGame is installed.

Make sure you install mono and Visual Studio for Mac first so that MonoGame can correctly setup the 
project templates and addins.
