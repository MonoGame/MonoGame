Welcome to the MonoGame game library documentation hub.

### WORK IN PROGRESS
Note that the MonoGame documentation project is currently a work in progress and applies to the **latest development build** of MonoGame.

If you are looking for documentation on previous releases of MonoGame you can reference our [GitHub wiki](http://github.com/mono/MonoGame/wiki) and the original [Codeplex documentation](http://monogame.codeplex.com/documentation) while we're getting this all sorted out.

### We Need Your Help!
Truly great open source projects require high quality documentation.  This is call for volunteers to help us make the MonoGame documentation truly great.  If you can help write tutorials, guides, code snippets, reference docs, video walkthroughs or just any improvement to our current documentation we could use your help!

Check out the [README on GitHub](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/Documentation/README.md) or [talk with us on the community site](http://community.monogame.net/t/lets-improve-the-monogame-documentation/916) to learn how to help!
