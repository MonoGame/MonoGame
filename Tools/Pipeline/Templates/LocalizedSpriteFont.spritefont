    CharacterRegions control what letters are available in the font. Every
    character from Start to End will be built and made available for drawing. The
    default range is from 32, (ASCII space), to 126, ('~'), covering the basic Latin
    character set. The characters are ordered according to the Unicode standard.
    See the documentation for more information.
    For localized fonts you can leave this empty as the character range will be picked up
    from the Resource Files.

    ResourceFiles control the charaters which will be in the font. It does this

    characters to the font.
