Place .XML files in the following folder to be included for PCL assemblies:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework\.NETPortable\v4.0\Profile\Profile2\SupportedFrameworks

(Note on some machines it may need to be in a different profile, try the following if it DOESN'T work)
C:\Program Files (x86)\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework\.NETPortable\v4.0\Profile\Profile104\SupportedFrameworks

*Note
As an alternative there is the new "Ninja Coder" addon for Visual Studio which will also install the PCL targets for you automatically:
