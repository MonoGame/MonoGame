software.

3. Conditions and Limitations

(A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use any
contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.

(B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you
claim are infringed by the software, your patent license from such contributor
to the software ends automatically.

(C) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain all
copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the
software.
