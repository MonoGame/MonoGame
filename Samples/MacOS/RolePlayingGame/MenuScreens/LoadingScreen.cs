    /// The loading screen coordinates transitions between the menu system and the
    /// game itself. Normally one screen will transition off at the same time as
    /// the next screen is transitioning on, but for larger transitions that can
    /// take a longer time to load their data, we want the menu system to be entirely
    /// gone before we start loading the game. This is done as follows:
    /// 
    /// - Tell all the existing screens to transition off.
    /// - Activate a loading screen, which will transition on at the same time.
    /// - The loading screen watches the state of the previous screens.
    /// - When it sees they have finished transitioning off, it activates the real
    ///   next screen, which may take a long time to load its data. The loading
    ///   screen will be the only thing displayed while this load is taking place.
