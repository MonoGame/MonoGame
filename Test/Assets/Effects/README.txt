For XNA effects can be compiled using the .csproj in this folder.
Simply build the csproj using MSBuild to compile the effects using
XNA's content importer and processor. To add an effect, just
copy-paste an existing entry and replace the effect path and name.

For DirectX and OpenGL use the pipeline tool to build the effects.
