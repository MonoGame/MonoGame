This is where you place links to your XNA content. You can use raw content files (png,jpeg,wav,mp3) but you
can also use the compiled content files from XNA (.xnb files).

When adding these files to the Content folder make sure they are Flagged as AndroidAsset. Then you can use the 
ContentManager.Load method as normal to load the Assets.

If you are loading xml Documents you will need to change your code to load the xml document via the Android Asset System.


var document;
#if ANDROID
   using (var stream = Game.Activity.Assets.Open("Content/somedocument.xml"))
   {
       document = XDocument.Load(stream);
   }
#else
   document = XDocument.Load("Content/somedocument.xml"); 
#endif
