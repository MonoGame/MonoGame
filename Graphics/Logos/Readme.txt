NOTES ABOUT THE MONOGAME LOGO AND LOGOTYPE

1. The "mono" and "Game" are Century Gothic Bold
2. The "mono" is written to the left of the logo, rotated counter-clockwise 90 degrees.
2. The "mono" is bottom aligned with the logo.
3. The "Game" is written above the logo left aligned with the left edge of the logo.
4. MonoGame.ai is derived from the SVG file and fixed up for curve alignment.
5. LogoNoText.psd is a smart object linked to MonoGame.ai
6. The logo is not transparent. It has a full white (0xFFFFFF) background.
7. TemplateSplash.psd is the source for the template splash screen. It uses a smart object
   that links the AI file (MonoGame.ai).
8. The SVG file is exported from the AI file using SVG 1.1
9. The orange gradient on the logo is gradient swatch #6 in the MonoGame.ai file.
10. The orange gradient is radial from RGB 255,192,1 to RGB 255,226,140 with a 50% break.
11. Template bugs for platform identification are placed in the upper left of the 
    template icon. The bug height is no larger than 40 pixels.
12. All pixel measurements are based upon screen pitch of 72 dpi.
13. The "Transparent" directory contains versions of the logo with a transparent background.
    All versions of the logo (logo and logotype) are supported here.
14. The "DarkBackground" directory contains the logotype imagery for use on a dark
    background. Only the Mono Game text is altered in these files. The alteration is to
    set the foreground of the text to be white with a transparent image background.
14. Dark background imagery only goes down to 96x96 because the Mono Game logotype
    does not convery to smaller sizes. Use the transparent graphics for smaller sizes.

The template splash screens are 480 x 800 to match the default screen format
of the XNA devices, e.g. Windows 7 and Windows 8 phone devices. A landscape format
is provided.

The icons (.ico and .icns) support up to 512 x 512 images. The higher resolution
ICNS files for the Mac require newer (10.5.x) versions of MacOS.

The "Windows" logo type is created with a 60 pt "W" and 55 pt "indows".

Logo images for iOS and Windows were taken from the Xamarin "Features" page.
