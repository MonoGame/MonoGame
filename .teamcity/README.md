# TeamCity Settings

This folder contains settings for the MonoGame TeamCity build process.

You can edit the settings in IntelliJ Idea, open the pom.xml and select the 'Open as a project' option.

You can also edit this manually in any text editor in the settings.kts. The TeamCity server will validate the changes and give you build errors if something is incorrect.

The documentation to the Kotlin language for TeamCity is here:  https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/kotlin-dsl.html
