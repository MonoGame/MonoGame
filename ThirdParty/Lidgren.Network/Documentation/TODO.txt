Completed features:
* Message coalescing
* Peer, connection statistics
* Lag, loss and duplication simulation for testing
* Connection approval
* Throttling
* Clock synchronization to detect jitter per packet (NetTime.RemoteNow)
* Peer discovery
* Message fragmentation

Missing features:
* Receipts 25% done, need design
* More realistic lag/loss (lumpy)
* Detect estimated packet loss
* More advanced ack packet
