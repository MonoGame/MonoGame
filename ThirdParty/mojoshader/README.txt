To use this in your project:

- Add mojoshader*.c and mojoshader*.h to your project.
- Compile mojoshader*.c
- If you don't have a C99-compliant compiler, like Microsoft Visual Studio,
  you'll need to compile the .c files as C++ to get them to build.
- If you don't have cmake to generate mojoshader_version.h, you can either
  add a blank file with that name, or add MOJOSHADER_NO_VERSION_INCLUDE to
  your preprocessor definitions.
