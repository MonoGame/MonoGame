With PositionLeft set to the minimum value, the left input is placed close  to the listener. In this position, early reflections are dominant, and the reverb decay  is set back in the sound field and reduced in amplitude. With PositionLeft set to the maximum value, the left input is placed at a maximum distance from the listener  within the simulated room. PositionLeft does not affect the reverb decay time  (liveness of the room), only the apparent position of the source relative to the listener.  Permitted range is from 0 to 30 (no units). </description></item>

            Position of the left input within the simulated space relative to the listener.  With PositionLeft set to the minimum value, the left input is placed close  to the listener. In this position, early reflections are dominant, and the reverb decay  is set back in the sound field and reduced in amplitude. With PositionLeft set to the maximum value, the left input is placed at a maximum distance from the listener  within the simulated room. PositionLeft does not affect the reverb decay time  (liveness of the room), only the apparent position of the source relative to the listener.  Permitted range is from 0 to 30 (no units).
