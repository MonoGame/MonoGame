            <remarks>	
            SetPrivateData makes a copy of the specified data and stores it with the object.Private data that SetPrivateData stores in the object occupies the same storage space as private data that is stored by associated Direct3D objects (for example, by a Microsoft Direct3D?11 device through <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.SetPrivateData"/> or by a Direct3D?11 child device through <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceChild.SetPrivateData"/>).The debug layer reports memory leaks by outputting a list of object interface references along with their friendly names. The default friendly name is "&lt;unnamed&gt;". You can set the friendly name so that you can determine if the corresponding object interface reference caused the leak. To set the friendly name, use the SetPrivateData method and the well-known private data <see cref="T:System.Guid"/> (<see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.CommonGuid.DebugObjectName"/>) that is in D3Dcommon.h. For example, to give pContext a friendly name of My name, use the following code:<code>	
             static const char c_szName[] = "My name";	
            hr = pContext-&gt;SetPrivateData( <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.CommonGuid.DebugObjectName"/>, sizeof( c_szName ) - 1, c_szName );	
            	
            </code>You can use <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.CommonGuid.DebugObjectName"/> to track down memory leaks and understand performance characteristics of your applications. This information is reflected in the output of the debug layer that is related to memory leaks (<see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Debug.ReportLiveDeviceObjects"/>) and with the event tracing for Windows events that we've added to Windows Developer Preview.

            This method is not supported by DXGI 1.0, which shipped in Windows?Vista and Windows Server?2008. DXGI 1.1 support is required, which is available on  Windows?7, Windows Server?2008?R2, and as an update to Windows?Vista with Service Pack?2 (SP2) (KB 971644) and Windows Server?2008 (KB 971512).After you use the GetDC method to retrieve a DC, you can render to the DXGI surface by using GDI.   The GetDC method readies the surface for GDI rendering and allows inter-operation between DXGI and GDI technologies.Keep the following in mind when using this method:You must create the surface by using the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.GdiCompatible"/> flag for a surface or by using the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainFlags.GdiCompatible"/> flag for swap chains,  otherwise this method fails. You must release the device and call the <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface1.ReleaseDC_(System.Nullable{SharpDX.Rectangle})"/> method before you issue any new Direct3D commands. This method fails if an outstanding DC has already been created by this method. The format for the surface or swap chain must be <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.B8G8R8A8_UNorm_SRgb"/> or <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.B8G8R8A8_UNorm"/>. On GetDC, the render target in the output merger of the Direct3D pipeline is unbound from the surface.   You must call the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.OutputMergerStage.SetRenderTargets"/> method on the device prior to Direct3D rendering after GDI rendering. Prior to resizing buffers you must release all outstanding DCs.You can also call GetDC on the back buffer at index 0 of a swap chain by obtaining an <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface1"/> from the swap chain.   The following code illustrates the process.<code>	
             <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain"/>* g_pSwapChain = <c>null</c>;	
            <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface1"/>* g_pSurface1 = <c>null</c>;

            A software adapter is a DLL that implements the entirety of a device driver interface, plus emulation, if necessary, of kernel-mode graphics components for Windows. Details on implementing a software adapter can be found in the Windows Vista Driver Development Kit. This is a very complex development task, and is not recommended for general readers. Calling this method will increment the module's reference count by one. The reference count can be decremented by calling {{FreeLibrary}}. The typical calling scenario is to call {{LoadLibrary}}, pass the handle to CreateSoftwareAdapter, then immediately call {{FreeLibrary}} on the DLL and forget the DLL's {{HMODULE}}. Since the software adapter calls FreeLibrary when it is destroyed, the lifetime of the DLL will now be owned by the adapter, and the application is free of any further consideration of its lifetime.

            <remarks>	
            The combination of WindowHandle and Flags informs DXGI to stop monitoring window messages for the previously-associated window.If the application switches to full-screen mode, DXGI will choose a full-screen resolution to be the smallest supported resolution that is larger or the same size as the current back buffer size.Applications can make some changes to make the transition from windowed to full screen more efficient. For example, on a WM_SIZE message, the application should release any outstanding swap-chain back buffers, call <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.ResizeBuffers(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.Format,SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainFlags)"/>, then re-acquire the back buffers from the swap chain(s). This gives the swap chain(s) an opportunity to resize the back buffers, and/or recreate them to enable full-screen flipping operation. If the application does not perform this sequence, DXGI will still make the full-screen/windowed transition, but may be forced to use a stretch operation (since the back buffers may not be the correct size), which may be less efficient. Even if a stretch is not required, presentation may not be optimal because the back buffers might not be directly interchangeable with the front buffer. Thus, a call to ResizeBuffers on WM_SIZE is always recommended, since WM_SIZE is always sent during a fullscreen transition.While windowed, the application can, if it chooses, restrict the size of its window's client area to sizes to which it is comfortable rendering. A fully flexible application would make no such restriction, but UI elements or other design considerations can, of course, make this flexibility untenable. If the application further chooses to restrict its window's client area to just those that match supported full-screen resolutions, the application can field WM_SIZING, then check against <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Output.FindClosestMatchingMode(SharpDX.DXGI.ModeDescription@,SharpDX.DXGI.ModeDescription@,SharpDX.ComObject)"/>. If a matching mode is found, allow the resize. (The <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Output"/> can be retrieved from <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.GetContainingOutput(SharpDX.DXGI.Output@)"/>. Absent subsequent changes to desktop topology, this will be the same output that will be chosen when alt-enter is fielded and fullscreen mode is begun for that swap chain.)Applications that want to handle mode changes or Alt+Enter themselves should call MakeWindowAssociation with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.WindowAssociationFlags.IgnoreAll"/> flag after swap chain creation. The WindowHandle argument, if non-<c>null</c>, specifies that the application message queues will not be handled by the DXGI runtime for all swap chains of a particular target <see cref="T:System.IntPtr"/>.  Calling MakeWindowAssociation with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.WindowAssociationFlags.IgnoreAll"/> flag after swapchain creation ensures that DXGI will not interfere with application's handling of window mode changes or Alt+Enter.Notes for Metro style appsIf a Metro style app calls MakeWindowAssociation, it fails with <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.ResultCode.NotCurrentlyAvailable"/>.A Microsoft Win32 application can use MakeWindowAssociation to control full-screen transitions through the Alt+Enter key combination and print screen behavior for full screen.  For Metro style apps, because DXGI cannot perform full-screen transitions, Metro style app have no way to control full-screen transitions.

            <remarks>	
            If you attempt to create a swap chain in full-screen mode, and full-screen mode is unavailable, the swap chain will be created in windowed mode and <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.DXGIStatus.Occluded"/> will be returned.If the buffer width or the buffer height is zero, the sizes will be inferred from the output window size in the swap-chain description.Because the target output cannot be chosen explicitly when the swap-chain is created, you should not create a full-screen swap chain. This can reduce presentation performance if the swap chain size and the output window size do not match. Here are two ways to ensure that the sizes match:Create a windowed swap chain and then set it full-screen using <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.SetFullscreenState(System.Boolean,SharpDX.DXGI.Output)"/>. Save a reference to the swap chain immediately after creation, and use it to get the output window size during a WM_SIZE event. Then resize the swap chain buffers (with <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.ResizeBuffers(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.Format,SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainFlags)"/>) during the transition from windowed to full-screen.If the swap chain is in full-screen mode, before you release it you must use SetFullscreenState to switch it to windowed mode. For more information about releasing a swap chain, see the "Destroying a Swap Chain" section of DXGI Overview.You can specify <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapEffect"/> and <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainFlags"/> values in the swap-chain description that pDesc points to. These values allow you to use features like flip-model presentation and content protection by using pre-Windows Developer Preview APIs.However, to use stereo presentation and to change resize behavior for the flip model, applications must use the IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForHwnd method. Otherwise, the back-buffer contents implicitly scale to fit the presentation target size; that is, you can't turn off scaling.Notes for Metro style appsIf a Metro style app calls CreateSwapChain with full screen specified, CreateSwapChain fails.Metro style apps call the  IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForImmersiveWindow method to create a swap chain.

            <remarks>	
            A software adapter is a DLL that implements the entirety of a device driver interface, plus emulation, if necessary, of kernel-mode graphics components for Windows. Details on implementing a software adapter can be found in the Windows Vista Driver Development Kit. This is a very complex development task, and is not recommended for general readers.Calling this method will increment the module's reference count by one. The reference count can be decremented by calling FreeLibrary.The typical calling scenario is to call LoadLibrary, pass the handle to CreateSoftwareAdapter, then immediately call FreeLibrary on the DLL and forget the DLL's HMODULE. Since the software adapter calls FreeLibrary when it is destroyed, the lifetime of the DLL will now be owned by the adapter, and the application is free of any further consideration of its lifetime.

            <remarks>	
            If you attempt to create a swap chain in full-screen mode, and full-screen mode is unavailable, the swap chain will be created in windowed mode and DXGI_STATUS_OCCLUDED will be returned. If the buffer width or the buffer height are zero, the sizes will be inferred from the output window size in the swap-chain description. Since the target output cannot be chosen explicitly when the swap-chain is created, you should not create a full-screen swap chain. This can reduce presentation performance if the swap chain size and the output window size do not match. Here are two ways to ensure the sizes match:  Create a windowed swap chain and then set it full-screen using <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.SetFullscreenState(System.Boolean,SharpDX.DXGI.Output)"/>. Save a reference to the swap-chain immediately after creation, and use it to get the output window size during a WM_SIZE event. Then resize the swap chain buffers (with <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.ResizeBuffers(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.Format,SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainFlags)"/>) during the transition from windowed to full-screen.  If the swap chain is in full-screen mode, before you release it, you must use {{SetFullscreenState}} to switch it to windowed mode. For more information about releasing a swap chain, see the Destroying a Swap Chain section of {{DXGI Overview}}.

            <remarks>	
            DXGI may change the display state of a swap chain in response to end user or system requests.We recommend that you create a windowed swap chain and allow the end user to change the swap chain to full screen through SetFullscreenState; that is, do not set the Windowed member of <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainDescription"/> to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/> to force the swap chain to be full screen. However, if you create the swap chain as full screen, also provide the end user with a list of supported display modes because a swap chain that is created with an unsupported display mode might cause the display to go black and prevent the end user from seeing anything. Also, we recommend that you have a time-out confirmation screen or other fallback mechanism when you allow the end user to change display modes.Notes for Metro style appsIf a Metro style app calls SetFullscreenState to set the display state to full screen, SetFullscreenState fails with <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.ResultCode.NotCurrentlyAvailable"/>.You cannot call SetFullscreenState on a windowless swap chain that you created with IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForCompositionSurface.For the flip presentation model, after you transition the display state to full screen, you must call ResizeBuffers to ensure that your call to IDXGISwapChain1::Present1 succeeds.

            <remarks>	
            You can't resize a swap chain unless you release all outstanding references to its back buffers. You must release all of its direct and indirect references on the back buffers in order for ResizeBuffers to succeed.Direct references are held by the application after it calls AddRef on a resource.Indirect references are held by views to a resource, binding a view of the resource to a device context,  a command list that used the resource, a command list that used a view to that resource, a command list that executed another command list that used the  resource, and so on.Before you call ResizeBuffers, ensure that the application releases all references (by calling the appropriate number of Release invocations)  on the resources, any views to the resource, and any command lists that use either the resources or views, and ensure that neither the resource nor a view is  still bound to a device context.  You can use <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.ClearState"/> to ensure that all references are released. If a view is bound to a deferred context, you must discard the partially built command list as well (by calling ClearState, <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.FinishCommandListInternal"/>, then Release on the command list).   After you call ResizeBuffers, you can re-query interfaces via <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.GetBuffer(System.Int32,System.Guid,System.IntPtr@)"/>.For swap chains that you created with <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainFlags.GdiCompatible"/>, before you call ResizeBuffers, also call <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface1.ReleaseDC_(System.Nullable{SharpDX.Rectangle})"/> on the swap chain's back-buffer surface to ensure that you have no outstanding GDI device contexts (DCs) open.We recommend that you call ResizeBuffers when a client window is resized (that is, when an application receives a WM_SIZE message).The only difference between ResizeBuffers in Windows Developer Preview and ResizeBuffers in Windows?7 is with flip presentation model swap chains that you create with the DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT_FLIP_SEQUENTIAL value set. In Windows Developer Preview, you must call ResizeBuffers to realize a transition between full-screen mode and windowed mode; otherwise, your next call to the Present method fails.

            ResizeTarget resizes the target window when the swap chain is in windowed mode, and changes the display mode on the target output when the swap  chain is in full-screen mode. Therefore, applications can call ResizeTarget to resize the target window (rather than a Microsoft Win32API such as SetWindowPos)  without knowledge of the swap chain display mode.If a Metro style app calls ResizeTarget, it fails with <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.ResultCode.NotCurrentlyAvailable"/>.You cannot call ResizeTarget on a windowless swap chain that you created with IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForCompositionSurface.

            Graphics applications can use the DXGI API to retrieve an accurate set of graphics memory  values on systems that have WDDM drivers. The following are the critical steps involved.Graphics driver model determination ? Because DXGI is only available on systems with WDDM drivers, the application must first confirm the driver model by using the following API.  	
            <code>	
             HasWDDMDriver()	
            { LPDIRECT3DCREATE9EX pD3D9Create9Ex = <c>null</c>; HMODULE             hD3D9          = <c>null</c>; hD3D9 = LoadLibrary( L"d3d9.dll" ); if ( <c>null</c> == hD3D9 ) { return false; } // /*  Try to create <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Direct3DEx"/> interface (also known as a DX9L interface). This interface can only be created if the driver is a WDDM driver. */ // pD3D9Create9Ex = (LPDIRECT3DCREATE9EX) GetProcAddress( hD3D9, "Direct3DCreate9Ex" ); return pD3D9Create9Ex != <c>null</c>;	
            } 	
            </code>	
                Retrieval of graphics memory values.? After the driver model is determined to be WDDM, the application can use the DirectX 10 or later API and DXGI to get the amount of graphics memory.

            <remarks>	
            Note??You can  use CheckInterfaceSupport only to  check whether a Direct3D 10.x interface is supported, and only on Windows Vista SP1 and later versions of the operating system. If you try to use CheckInterfaceSupport to check whether a Direct3D 11.x and later version interface is supported, CheckInterfaceSupport returns <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.ResultCode.Unsupported"/>. Therefore, do not use CheckInterfaceSupport. Instead, to verify whether the operating system supports a particular interface, try to create the interface. For example, if you call the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateBlendState"/> method and it fails, the operating system does not support the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.BlendState"/> interface.

            Graphics applications can use the DXGI API to retrieve an accurate set of graphics memory  values on systems that have WDDM drivers. The following are the critical steps involved.Graphics driver model determination ? Because DXGI is only available on systems with WDDM drivers, the application must first confirm the driver model by using the following API.  	
            <code>	
             HasWDDMDriver()	
            { LPDIRECT3DCREATE9EX pD3D9Create9Ex = <c>null</c>; HMODULE             hD3D9          = <c>null</c>; hD3D9 = LoadLibrary( L"d3d9.dll" ); if ( <c>null</c> == hD3D9 ) { return false; } // /*  Try to create <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Direct3DEx"/> interface (also known as a DX9L interface). This interface can only be created if the driver is a WDDM driver. */ // pD3D9Create9Ex = (LPDIRECT3DCREATE9EX) GetProcAddress( hD3D9, "Direct3DCreate9Ex" ); return pD3D9Create9Ex != <c>null</c>;	
            } 	
            </code>	
                Retrieval of graphics memory values.? After the driver model is determined to be WDDM, the application can use the DirectX 10 or later API and DXGI to get the amount of graphics memory.  After creating a Direct3D device the following code can be used to obtain  a <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.AdapterDescription"/> structure containing the amount of available graphics memory.  	
            <code>

            <remarks>	
            The CreateSurface method creates a buffer to exchange data between one or more devices. It is used internally, and you should not directly call it.The runtime automatically creates an <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/> interface when it creates a Direct3D resource object that represents a surface. For example, the runtime creates an <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/> interface when it calls <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateTexture2D"/> or <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device.CreateTexture2D"/> to create a 2D texture. To retrieve the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/> interface that represents the 2D texture surface, call ID3D11Texture2D::QueryInterface or ID3D10Texture2D::QueryInterface. In this call, you must pass the identifier of <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/>. If the 2D texture has only a single MIP-map level and does not consist of an array of textures, QueryInterface succeeds and returns a reference to the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/> interface reference. Otherwise, QueryInterface fails and does not return the reference to <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/>.

            The values for the Priority parameter function as follows:Positive values increase the likelihood that the GPU scheduler will grant GPU execution cycles to the device when rendering. Negative values lessen the likelihood that the device will receive GPU execution cycles when devices compete for them. The device is guaranteed to receive some GPU execution cycles at all settings.To use the SetGPUThreadPriority method, you should have a comprehensive understanding of GPU scheduling. You should profile your application to ensure that it behaves as intended. If used inappropriately, the SetGPUThreadPriority method can impede rendering speed and result in a poor user experience.

            <remarks>	
            The AcquireSync method creates a lock to a surface that is shared between multiple devices, allowing only one device to render to a surface at a time.   This method uses a key to determine which device currently has exclusive access to the surface.When a surface is created using the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.ResourceOptionFlags.SharedKeyedmutex"/> value of the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.ResourceOptionFlags"/> enumeration,  you must call the AcquireSync method before rendering to the surface.  You must call the ReleaseSync method when you are done  rendering to a surface.To acquire a reference to the keyed mutex object of a shared resource, call the QueryInterface method of the resource and pass in  the UUID of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.KeyedMutex"/> interface.  For more information about acquiring this reference, see the following code example.The AcquireSync method uses the key as follows, depending on the state of the surface:On initial creation, the surface is unowned and any device can call the AcquireSync method to gain access.  For an unowned device, only a key of 0 will succeed. Calling the AcquireSync method for any other key will stall the  calling CPU thread. If the surface is owned by a device when you call the AcquireSync method, the CPU thread that called  the AcquireSync method will stall until the owning device calls the ReleaseSync method  using the same Key. If the surface is unowned when you call the AcquireSync method (for example, the last owning device has already called  the ReleaseSync method), the AcquireSync method will succeed if you specify the same key  that was specified when the ReleaseSync method was last called. Calling the AcquireSync method using  any other key will cause a stall. When the owning device calls the ReleaseSync method with a particular key, and more than one device is waiting after  calling the  AcquireSync method using the same key, any one of the waiting devices could be woken up first.  The order in which devices are woken up is undefined. A keyed mutex does not support recursive calls to the AcquireSync method.

            FindClosestMatchingMode behaves similarly to the IDXGIOutput1::FindClosestMatchingMode1 except FindClosestMatchingMode considers only the mono display modes. IDXGIOutput1::FindClosestMatchingMode1 considers only stereo modes if you set the Stereo member in the DXGI_MODE_DESC1 structure that pModeToMatch points to, and considers only mono modes if Stereo is not set.IDXGIOutput1::FindClosestMatchingMode1 returns a matched display-mode set with only stereo modes or only mono modes.	
            FindClosestMatchingMode behaves as though you specified the input mode as mono.

This is true regardless of target monitor rotation. A destination surface created by a graphics component (such as Direct3D 10) must be created with CPU-write permission (see <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.CpuAccessFlags.Write"/>). Other surfaces should be created with CPU read-write permission (see D3D10_CPU_ACCESS_READ_WRITE). This method will modify the surface data to fit the destination surface (stretch, shrink, convert format, rotate). The stretch and shrink is performed with point-sampling.

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            Direct3D devices require UNORM formats. This method finds the closest matching available display mode to the mode specified in pModeToMatch. Similarly ranked fields (ie. all specified, or all unspecified, etc) are resolved in the following order.  ScanlineOrdering Scaling Format Resolution RefreshRate  When determining the closest value for a particular field, previously matched fields are used to filter the display mode list choices, and  other fields are ignored. For example, when matching Resolution, the display mode list will have already been filtered by a certain ScanlineOrdering,  Scaling, and Format, while RefreshRate is ignored. This ordering doesn't define the absolute ordering for every usage scenario of FindClosestMatchingMode, because  the application can choose some values initially, effectively changing the order that fields are chosen. Fields of the display mode are matched one at a time, generally in a specified order. If a field is unspecified, FindClosestMatchingMode gravitates toward the values for the desktop related to this output.  If this output is not part of the desktop, then the default desktop output is used to find values. If an application uses a fully unspecified  display mode, FindClosestMatchingMode will typically return a display mode that matches the desktop settings for this output.   Unspecified fields are lower priority than specified fields and will be resolved later than specified fields.

            In general, when switching from windowed to full-screen mode, a swap chain automatically chooses a display mode that meets (or exceeds) the resolution, color  depth and refresh rate of the swap chain. To exercise more control over the display mode, use this API to poll the set of display modes that are validated  against monitor capabilities, or all modes that match the desktop (if the desktop settings are not validated against the monitor). As shown, this API is designed to be called twice. First to get the number of modes available, and second to return a description of the modes.

            You can pass the handle that  GetSharedHandle returns in a call to the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.OpenSharedResource"/> method to give a device access to a shared resource that you created on a different device.GetSharedHandle doesn't always return a handle. GetSharedHandle only returns the handle when you  created the resource as shared (that is, you set the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.Shared"/> or <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.SharedKeyedmutex"/> flag).The handle that  GetSharedHandle returns is not an NT handle. Therefore, don't use the handle with CloseHandle, DuplicateHandle, and so on. The creator of a shared resource must not destroy the resource until all entities that  opened the resource have destroyed the resource. The validity of the handle is tied to the lifetime of the underlying video memory. If no resource objects exist on any devices that refer to this resource, the handle is no longer valid. To extend the lifetime of the handle and video memory, you must open the shared resource on a device.

            [Starting with Direct3D 11.1, we recommend not to use GetSharedHandle anymore to retrieve the handle to a shared resource. Instead, use IDXGIResource1::CreateSharedHandle to get a handle for sharing. To use IDXGIResource1::CreateSharedHandle, you  must create the resource as shared and specify that it uses NT handles (that is, you set the D3D11_RESOURCE_MISC_SHARED_NTHANDLE flag). We also recommend that you create shared resources that use NT handles so you can use CloseHandle, DuplicateHandle, and so on on those shared resources.]

            The eviction priority is a memory-management variable that is used by DXGI to determine how to manage overcommitted memory.Priority levels other than the defined values are used when appropriate. For example, a resource with a priority level of 0x78000001 indicates that the resource is slightly above normal.

            A few formats have additional restrictions.A resource declared with the DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32 family of formats cannot be used simultaneously for vertex and texture data. That is, you may not create a buffer resource with the DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32 family of formats that uses any of the following bind flags: <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.BindFlags.VertexBuffer"/>, <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.BindFlags.IndexBuffer"/>, <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.BindFlags.ConstantBuffer"/>, or <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.BindFlags.StreamOutput"/> (see <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.BindFlags"/>). <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R1_UNorm"/> is designed specifically for text filtering, and must be used with a format-specific, configurable 8x8 filter mode. When calling an HLSL sampling function using this format, the address offset parameter must be set to (0,0). A resource using a sub-sampled format (such as DXGI_FORMAT_R8G8_B8G8) must have a size that is a multiple of 2 in the x dimension. Format is not available in Direct3D 10 and Direct3D 10.1The following topics provide lists of the formats that particular hardware feature levels support:Hardware Support for Direct3D 11.1 Formats   Hardware Support for Direct3D 11 Formats   Hardware Support for Direct3D 10.1 Formats   Hardware Support for Direct3D 10 Formats   Hardware Support for Direct3D 10Level9 FormatsFor a list of the DirectXMath types that map to <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Format"/> values, see DirectXMath Library Internals.Format ModifiersEach enumeration value contains a format modifier which describes the data type.Format ModifiersDescription _FLOATA floating-point value; 32-bit floating-point formats use IEEE 754 single-precision (s23e8 format): sign bit, 8-bit biased (127) exponent,  and 23-bit mantissa. 16-bit floating-point formats use half-precision (s10e5 format): sign bit, 5-bit biased (15) exponent, and 10-bit mantissa. _SINTTwo's complement signed integer. For example, a 3-bit SINT represents the values -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. _SNORMSigned normalized integer; which is interpreted in a resource as a signed integer, and is interpreted in a shader as a signed normalized floating-point value in the range [-1, 1]. For an 2's complement number, the maximum value is 1.0f (a 5-bit value 01111 maps to 1.0f), and the minimum value is -1.0f (a 5-bit value 10000 maps to -1.0f). In addition, the second-minimum number maps to -1.0f (a 5-bit value 10001 maps to -1.0f). The resulting integer representations are evenly spaced floating-point values in the range (-1.0f...0.0f), and also a complementary set of representations for numbers in the range (0.0f...1.0f). _SRGBStandard RGB data, which roughly displays colors in a linear ramp of luminosity levels such that an average observer, under average viewing conditions, can view them on an average display.  <para>All 0's maps to 0.0f, and all 1's maps to 1.0f. The sequence of unsigned integer encodings between all 0's and all 1's represent a nonlinear progression in the floating-point interpretation of the numbers between 0.0f to 1.0f. For more detail, see the SRGB color standard, IEC 61996-2-1, at IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission).</para>	
             Conversion to or from sRGB space is automatically done by D3DX10 or D3DX9 texture-load functions. If the format has an alpha channel, the alpha data is also stored in sRGB color space.  _TYPELESSTypeless data, with a defined number of bits. Typeless formats are designed for creating typeless resources; that is, a resource whose size is known, but whose data type is not yet fully defined. When a typeless resource is bound to a shader, the application or shader must resolve the format type (which must match the number of bits per component in the typeless format). <para>A typeless format contains one or more subformats; each subformat resolves the data type. For example, in the R32G32B32 group, which defines types for three-component 96-bit data, there is one typeless format and three fully typed subformats.</para>

               _UINTUnsigned integer. For instance, a 3-bit UINT represents the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. _UNORMUnsigned normalized integer; which is interpreted in a resource as an unsigned integer, and is interpreted in a shader as an unsigned normalized floating-point value in the range [0, 1]. All 0's maps to 0.0f, and all 1's maps to 1.0f. A sequence of evenly spaced floating-point values from 0.0f to 1.0f are represented. For instance, a 2-bit UNORM represents 0.0f, 1/3, 2/3, and 1.0f.?New Resource FormatsDirect3D 10 offers new data compression formats for compressing high-dynamic range (HDR) lighting data, normal maps and heightfields to a fraction of their original size. These compression types include:Shared-Exponent high-dynamic range (HDR) format (RGBE) New Block-Compressed 1-2 channel UNORM/SNORM formatsThe block compression formats can be used for any of the 2D or 3D texture types ( Texture2D, Texture2DArray, Texture3D, or TextureCube) including mipmap surfaces. The block compression techniques require texture dimensions to be a multiple of 4 (since the implementation compresses on blocks of 4x4 texels). In the texture sampler, compressed formats are always decompressed before texture filtering.

That is, presented content is not accessible by remote access or through the desktop duplication APIs.Swap chains that you create with the IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForHwnd, IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForImmersiveWindow, and  IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForCompositionSurface methods are not protected if DXGI_SWAP_CHAIN_FLAG_DISPLAY_ONLY is not set and are protected if DXGI_SWAP_CHAIN_FLAG_DISPLAY_ONLY is set. When swap chains are protected, screen scraping is prevented and, in full-screen mode, presented content is not accessible through the desktop duplication APIs.

            Options for handling pixels in a display surface after calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.Present(System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.PresentFlags)"/>.

            <remarks>	
            This enumeration is used by the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainDescription"/> structure.This enumeration is also used by the  DXGI_SWAP_CHAIN_DESC1 structure.The primary difference between presentation models is how back-buffer contents get to the Desktop Window Manager (DWM) for composition. In the bitblt model, which is used with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapEffect.Discard"/> and <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapEffect.Sequential"/> values, contents of the back buffer get copied into the redirection surface on each call to <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.Present(System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.PresentFlags)"/>. In the flip model, which is used with the DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT_FLIP_SEQUENTIAL value, all back buffers are shared with the DWM. Therefore, the DWM can compose straight from those back buffers without any additional copy operations.	
            In general, the flip model is the more efficient model. The flip model also provides more features, such as enhanced present statistics.Regardless of whether the flip model is more efficient, an application still might choose the bitblt model for the following reasons:<para>The bitblt model is the only way to mix GDI and DirectX presentation.</para>	
             <para>In the flip model, the application must create the swap chain with <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainFlags.GdiCompatible"/>, and then must use GetDC on the back buffer explicitly. After the first successful call to <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.Present(System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.PresentFlags)"/> on a flip-model swap chain, GDI no longer works with the <see cref="T:System.IntPtr"/> that is associated with that swap chain, even after the destruction of the swap chain. This restriction even extends to methods like ScrollWindowEx.</para>	
              The flip model requires at least three window-sized buffers if the application uses child windows. For the bitblt model, this minimum is two buffers.

            <remarks>	
            The following format values are valid for display modes and when you create a bit-block transfer (bitblt) model swap chain. The valid values depend on the feature level that you are working with.<para>Feature level &gt;= 9.1</para>	
               <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R8G8B8A8_UNorm"/>  <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R8G8B8A8_UNorm_SRgb"/>  <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.B8G8R8A8_UNorm"/> (except 10.x on Windows?Vista) <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.B8G8R8A8_UNorm_SRgb"/> (except 10.x on Windows?Vista)    <para>Feature level &gt;= 10.0</para>

              <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R10G10B10_Xr_Bias_A2_UNorm"/>You can pass one of these format values to <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CheckFormatSupport"/> to determine if it is a valid format for displaying on screen. If <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CheckFormatSupport"/> returns <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.FormatSupport.Display"/> in the bit field to which the pFormatSupport parameter points, the format is valid for displaying on screen.Starting with Windows Developer Preview for a flip model swap chain (that is, a swap chain that has the DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT_FLIP_SEQUENTIAL value set in the SwapEffect member of <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainDescription"/>), you must set the Format member of <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.ModeDescription"/> to <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R16G16B16A16_Float"/>, <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.B8G8R8A8_UNorm"/>, or <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R8G8B8A8_UNorm"/>.Because of the relaxed render target creation rules that Direct3D 11 has for back buffers, applications can create a <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.B8G8R8A8_UNorm_SRgb"/> render target view from a <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.B8G8R8A8_UNorm"/> swap chain so they can use automatic color space conversion when they render the swap chain.

            You initialize the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.FrameStatistics"/> structure with the <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Output.GetFrameStatistics(SharpDX.DXGI.FrameStatistics@)"/> or <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.GetFrameStatistics(SharpDX.DXGI.FrameStatistics@)"/> method.You can only use <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.GetFrameStatistics(SharpDX.DXGI.FrameStatistics@)"/> for swap chains that either use the flip presentation model or draw in full-screen mode. You set the DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT_FLIP_SEQUENTIAL value in the SwapEffect member of the DXGI_SWAP_CHAIN_DESC1 structure to specify that the swap chain uses the flip presentation model.The values in the PresentCount and PresentRefreshCount members indicate information about when a frame was presented on the display screen. You can use these values to determine whether a glitch occurred. The values in the SyncRefreshCount and SyncQPCTime members indicate timing information that you can use for audio and video synchronization or very precise animation. If the swap chain draws in full-screen mode, these values are based on when the computer booted. 	
            If the swap chain draws in windowed mode, these values are based on when the swap chain is created.

            Use a DXGI 1.1 factory to generate objects that enumerate adapters,  create swap chains, and associate a window with  the alt+enter key sequence for toggling to and from the full-screen display mode.If the CreateDXGIFactory1 function succeeds, the reference count on the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory1"/> interface is incremented. To avoid a memory leak, when you finish using the interface, call the IDXGIFactory1::Release method to release the interface.This entry point is not supported by DXGI 1.0, which shipped in Windows?Vista and Windows Server?2008. DXGI 1.1 support is required, which is available on  Windows?7, Windows Server?2008?R2, and as an update to Windows?Vista with Service Pack?2 (SP2) (KB 971644) and Windows Server?2008 (KB 971512).Note??Do not mix the use of DXGI 1.0 (<see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory"/>) and DXGI 1.1 (<see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory1"/>) in an application. Use <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory"/> or <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory1"/>, but not both in an application.
