            The {{Outline}} method allows the caller to produce a geometry with an equivalent fill to the input geometry, with the following additional properties: The output geometry contains no transverse intersections; that is, segments may touch, but they never cross.The outermost figures in the output geometry are all oriented counterclockwise. The output geometry is fill-mode invariant; that is, the fill of the geometry does not depend on the choice of the fill mode. For more information about the fill mode, see <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.FillMode"/>.Additionally, the  {{Outline}} method can be useful in removing redundant portions of said geometries to simplify complex geometries.

            <remarks>	
            The Outline method allows the caller to produce a geometry with an equivalent fill to the input geometry, with the following additional properties:The output geometry contains no transverse intersections; that is, segments may touch, but they never cross. The outermost figures in the output geometry are all oriented counterclockwise.  The output geometry is fill-mode invariant; that is, the fill of the geometry does not depend on the choice of the fill mode. For more information about the fill mode, see <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.FillMode"/>.Additionally, the  Outline method can be useful in removing redundant portions of said geometries to simplify complex geometries. It can also be useful in combination with <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.GeometryGroup"/> to create unions among several geometries simultaneously.

            Some formats, such as GIF and ICO, do not have full DPI support. For GIF, this method calculates the DPI values from the aspect ratio, using a base DPI of (96.0, 96.0). The ICO format does not support DPI at all, and the method always returns (96.0,96.0) for ICO images.Additionally, WIC itself does not transform images based on the DPI values in an image. It is up to the caller to transform an image based on the resolution returned.

            <remarks>	
            CopyPixels is one of the two main image processing routines (the other being Lock) triggering the actual processing.  It instructs the object to produce pixels according to its algorithm - this may involve decoding a portion of a JPEG stored on disk, copying a block of memory, or even analytically computing a complex gradient.  The algorithm is completely dependent on the object implementing the interface.The caller can restrict the operation to a rectangle of interest (ROI) using the prc parameter.  The ROI sub-rectangle must be fully contained in the bounds of the bitmap.  Specifying a <c>null</c> ROI implies that the whole bitmap should be returned.The caller controls the memory management and must provide an output buffer (pbBuffer) for the results of the copy along with the buffer's bounds (cbBufferSize).  The cbStride parameter defines the count of bytes between two vertically adjacent pixels in the output buffer.  The caller must ensure that there is sufficient buffer to complete the call based on the width, height and pixel format of the bitmap and the sub-rectangle provided to the copy method.If the caller needs to perform numerous copies of an expensive <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapSource"/> such as a JPEG, it is recommended to create an in-memory <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.Bitmap"/> first.Codec Developer RemarksThe callee must only write to the first (prc-&gt;Width*bitsperpixel+7)/8 bytes of each line of the output buffer (in this case, a line is a consecutive string of cbStride bytes).

            This method has no effect on the actual pixels or samples stored in the bitmap.  Instead the interpretation of the sampling rate is modified.  This means that a 96 DPI image which is 96 pixels wide is one inch.  If the physical resolution is modified to 48 DPI, then the bitmap is considered to be 2 inches wide but has the same number of pixels.   If the resolution is less than REAL_EPSILON (1.192092896e-07F) the error code WINCODEC_ERR_INVALIDPARAMETER is returned.

If dwProgressFlags includes <see cref="F:SharpDX.WIC.ProgressNotification.Begin"/>, the callback is guaranteed to be called with progress 0.0. If dwProgressFlags includes <see cref="F:SharpDX.WIC.ProgressNotification.End"/>, the callback is guaranteed to be called with progress 1.0.WICProgressNotificationFrequent increases the frequency in which the callback is called. If an operation is expected to take more than 30 seconds, <see cref="F:SharpDX.WIC.ProgressNotification.Frequent"/> should be added to dwProgressFlags.

            <remarks>	
            The parameter ppIEncoderOptions can be used to receive an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Win32.PropertyBag"/> that can then be used to specify encoder options. This is done by passing a reference to a NULLIPropertyBag2 reference in ppIEncoderOptions. You should then set your desired encoder options on the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Win32.PropertyBag"/> returned, and pass this <see cref="T:SharpDX.Win32.PropertyBag"/> to <see cref="M:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapFrameEncode.Initialize(SharpDX.Win32.PropertyBag)"/>.Note??Do not pass in a reference to an initialized <see cref="T:SharpDX.Win32.PropertyBag"/>. The reference will be overwritten, and the original <see cref="T:SharpDX.Win32.PropertyBag"/> will not be freed.Otherwise, you can pass <c>null</c> in ppIEncoderOptions if you do not intend to specify encoder options.See Encoding Overview for an example of how to set encoder options.

            <summary>	
            Though optional, we highly recommend that every decoder implement this interface on your frame-level decoding class, because it can provide major performance benefits.  When an application requests a specific region of interest, size, orientation, or pixel format, instead of just decoding the whole image at full resolution and then applying the requested transforms, Windows Imaging Component (WIC) calls IUnknown::QueryInterface for this interface on the <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapFrameDecode"/> object.  If the frame decoder supports it, WIC calls the appropriate method or methods to determine whether the frame decoder can perform the requested transform or determine the closest size or pixel format the decoder can provide to the one requested.  If the decoder can perform the requested transform or transforms, WIC invokes CopyPixels with the appropriate parameters.  If the decoder can perform some, but not all of the requested transforms, WIC asks the decoder to perform those that it can, and uses the WIC transform objects (<see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapScaler"/>, <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapClipper"/>, <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapFlipRotator"/>, and <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.FormatConverter"/>) to perform the remaining transforms that could not be performed by the frame decoder on the result of the CopyPixels call.  If the decoder doesn't support <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapSourceTransform"/>, then WIC must use the transform objects to perform all of the transforms. It's usually much more efficient for the decoder to perform transforms during the decoding process than it is to decode the entire image and then perform the transforms. This is especially true for operations such as scaling to a much smaller size or pixel format conversions.

            Codec Developer RemarksFor codec developer implementation details for this method, see Implementing <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapSourceTransform"/>.When multiple transform operations are requested, the result is dependent on the order in which the operations are performed. To ensure predictability and consistency across CODECs, it's important that all CODECs perform these operations in the same order. The recommended order of these operations is:Scale Crop Flip/RotatePixel format conversion can be performed at any time, since it has no effect on the other transforms.The first parameter, prc is used to specify the region of interest for clipping the image. By convention, scaling is performed before clipping so, if the image is to be scaled as well as clipped, the region of interest should be determined after the image has been scaled.If a dstTransform is specified, the stride is the transformed stride, and is based on the pixelFormat specified in the CopyPixels call, not the original frame's pixel format.

            <remarks>	
            Codec implementers should faithfully adjust the color temperature within the range supported natively by the raw image. For values outside the native support range, the codec implementer should provide a best effort representation of the image at that color temperature.Codec implementers should return WINCODEC_ERR_VALUEOUTOFRANGE if the value is out of defined acceptable range.Codec implementers must ensure proper interoperability with other white point setting methods such as SetWhitePointRGB. For example, if the caller sets the white point via SetNamedWhitePoint then the codec implementer may want to disable reading back the correspoinding Kelvin temperature. In specific cases where the codec implementer wants to deny a given action because of previous calls, WINCODEC_ERR_WRONGSTATE should be returned.

            If the commit fails and returns WINCODEC_ERR_STREAMNOTAVAILABLE, ensure that the image decoder was loaded using the <see cref="F:SharpDX.WIC.DecodeOptions.CacheOnDemand"/> option. A fast metadata encoder is not supported when the decoder is created using the <see cref="F:SharpDX.WIC.DecodeOptions.CacheOnLoad"/> option.If the commit fails for any reason, you will need to re-encode the image to ensure the new metadata is added to the image.

            <remarks>	
            If you do not have a predefined palette, you must first create one. Use InitializeFromBitmap to create the palette object, then pass it in along with your other parameters.dither, pIPalette, alphaThresholdPercent, and paletteTranslate are used to mitigate color loss when converting to a reduced bit-depth format. For conversions that do not need these settings, the following parameters values should be used: dither set to <see cref="F:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapDitherType.None"/>, pIPalette set to <c>null</c>, alphaThresholdPercent set to 0.0f, and paletteTranslate set to <see cref="F:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapPaletteType.Custom"/>.The basic algorithm involved when using an ordered dither requires a fixed palette, found in the <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapPaletteType"/> enumeration, in a specific order. Often, the actual palette provided for the output may have a different ordering or some slight variation in the actual colors.  This is the case when using the Microsoft?Windows palette which has slight differences among versions of Windows. To provide for this, a palette and a palette translation are given to the format converter.  The pIPalette is the actual destination palette to be used and the paletteTranslate is a fixed palette.  Once the conversion is complete, the colors are mapped from the fixed palette to the actual colors in pIPalette using a nearest color matching algorithm.If colors in pIPalette do not closely match those in paletteTranslate, the mapping may produce undesireable results.WICBitmapDitherTypeOrdered4x4 can be useful in format conversions from 8-bit formats to 5- or 6-bit formats as there is no way to accurately convert color data.WICBitmapDitherTypeErrorDiffusion selects the error diffusion algorithm and may be used with any palette.  If an arbitrary palette is provided, WICBitmapPaletteCustom should be passed in as the paletteTranslate.  Error diffusion often provides superior results compared to the ordered dithering algorithms especially when combined with the optimized palette generation functionality on the <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.Palette"/>.When converting a bitmap which has an alpha channel, such as a Portable Network Graphics (PNG), to 8bpp, the alpha channel is normally ignored.  Any pixels which were transparent in the original bitmap show up as black in the final output because both transparent and black have pixel values of zero in the respective formats.Some 8bpp content can contains an alpha color; for instance, the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) format allows for a single palette entry to be used as a transparent color. For this type of content, alphaThresholdPercent specifies what percentage of transparency should map to the transparent color. Because the alpha value is directly proportional to the opacity (not transparency) of a pixel, the alphaThresholdPercent indicates what level of opacity is mapped to the fully transparent color.  For instance, 9.8% implies that any pixel with an alpha value of less than 25 will be mapped to the transparent color.  A value of 100% maps all pixels which are not fully opaque to the transparent color. Note that the palette should provide a transparent color. If it does not, the 'transparent' color will be the one closest to zero - often black.

            The format converter does not necessarily guarantee symmetricality with respect to conversion; that is, a converter may be able to convert FROM a particular format without actually being able to convert TO a particular format. In order to test symmetricality, use CanConvert.To determine the number of pixel formats a coverter can handle, set cFormats to 0 and pPixelFormatGUIDs to <c>null</c>. The converter will fill pcActual with the number of formats supported by that converter.

The algorithm operates on the opaque RGB color value of each pixel in the reference bitmap and hence ignores any alpha values. If a transparent color is required, set the fAddTransparentColor parameter to TRUE and one fewer optimized color will be computed, reducing the colorCount, and a fully transparent color entry will be added.

            <remarks>	
            The CreateSharedBitmap method is useful for efficiently reusing bitmap data and can also be used to provide interoperability with Direct3D.Sharing an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Bitmap"/>By passing an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Bitmap"/> created by a render target that is resource-compatible, you can share a bitmap with that render target; both the original <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Bitmap"/> and the new <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Bitmap"/> created by this method will point to the same bitmap data. For more information about when render target resources can be shared, see the Sharing Render Target Resources section of the Resources Overview.You may also use this method to reinterpret the data of an existing bitmap and specify a new DPI or alpha mode. For example, in the case of a bitmap atlas, an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Bitmap"/> may contain multiple sub-images, each of which should be rendered with a different <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.AlphaMode"/> (<see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.AlphaMode.Premultiplied"/> or <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.AlphaMode.Ignore"/>). You could use the CreateSharedBitmap method to reinterpret the bitmap using the desired alpha mode  without having to load a separate copy of the bitmap into memory.Sharing an <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/>When using a DXGI surface render target (an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget"/> object created by the CreateDxgiSurfaceRenderTarget method), you can pass an  <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/> surface to the CreateSharedBitmap method to share video memory with Direct3D and manipulate Direct3D content as an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Bitmap"/>. As described in  the Resources Overview, the render target and the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/> must be using the same Direct3D device.Note also that the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/> must use one of the supported pixel formats and alpha modes described in Supported Pixel Formats and Alpha Modes.For more information about interoperability with Direct3D, see the Direct2D and Direct3D Interoperability Overview.Sharing an <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapLock"/>An <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapLock"/> stores the content of a WIC bitmap and shields it from simultaneous accesses. By passing an <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapLock"/> to the CreateSharedBitmap method, you can create an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Bitmap"/> that points to the bitmap data already stored in the  <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapLock"/>.To use an <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapLock"/> with the CreateSharedBitmap method, the render target must use software rendering. To force a render target to use software rendering, set to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTargetType.Software"/> the type field of the  <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTargetProperties"/> structure that you use to create the render target. To check whether an existing render target uses software rendering, use the IsSupported method.

            The PushLayer method allows a caller to begin redirecting rendering to a layer. All rendering operations are valid in a layer. The location of the layer is affected by the world transform set on the render target.Each PushLayer must have a matching PopLayer call. If there are more PopLayer calls than PushLayer calls, the render target is placed into an error state. If Flush is called before all outstanding layers are popped, the render target is placed into an error state, and an error is returned. The error state can be cleared by a call to EndDraw.A particular <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Layer"/> resource can be active only at one time. In other words, you cannot call a PushLayer method, and then immediately follow  with another PushLayer method with the same layer resource. Instead, you must call the second PushLayer method with different layer resources.This method doesn't return an error code if it fails. To determine whether a drawing operation (such as PushLayer) failed, check the result returned by the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget.EndDraw(System.Int64@,System.Int64@)"/> or <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget.Flush(System.Int64@,System.Int64@)"/> methods.

After the transform is applied to the clipRect that is passed in, the axis-aligned bounding box for the clipRect is computed.

             <para></para>Note??If rendering operations fail or if PopAxisAlignedClip is not called, clip rects may cause some artifacts on the render target. PopAxisAlignedClip can be considered a drawing operation that is designed to fix the borders of a clipping region. Without this call, the borders of a clipped area may be not antialiased or otherwise corrected.The PushAxisAlignedClip and PopAxisAlignedClip must match. Otherwise, the error state is set. For the render target to continue receiving new commands, you can call Flush to clear the error.A           PushAxisAlignedClip and PopAxisAlignedClip pair can occur around or within a PushLayer and PopLayer, but cannot overlap.

Different implementations of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget"/> might behave differently when BeginDraw is called. An <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapRenderTarget"/> may be locked between BeginDraw/EndDraw calls, a DXGI surface render target might be acquired on BeginDraw and released on EndDraw, while an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.WindowRenderTarget"/> may begin batching at BeginDraw and may present on EndDraw, for example.The BeginDraw method must be called before rendering operations can be called, though state-setting and state-retrieval operations can be performed even outside of BeginDraw/EndDraw.After BeginDraw is called, a render target will normally build up a batch of rendering commands, but defer processing of these commands until either an internal buffer is full, the Flush method is called, or until EndDraw is called. The EndDraw method causes any batched drawing operations to complete, and then returns an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Result"/> indicating the success of the operations and, optionally, the tag state of the render target at the time the error occurred. The EndDraw method always succeeds: it should not be called twice even if a previous EndDraw resulted in a failing <see cref="T:SharpDX.Result"/>.If EndDraw is called without a matched call to BeginDraw, it returns an error indicating that BeginDraw must be called before EndDraw. Calling BeginDraw twice on a render target puts the target into an error state where nothing further is drawn, and returns an appropriate <see cref="T:SharpDX.Result"/> and error information when EndDraw is called.

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            To write to a Direct3D surface, you obtain an <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/> and pass it to the {{CreateDxgiSurfaceRenderTarget}} method to create a DXGI surface render target; you can then use the DXGI surface render target to draw 2-D content to the DXGI surface.  A DXGI surface render target is a type of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget"/>. Like other Direct2D render targets, you can use it to create resources and issue drawing commands. The DXGI surface render target and the DXGI surface must use the same DXGI format. If you specify the {{DXGI_FORMAT_UNKOWN}} format when you create the render target, it will automatically use the surface's format.The DXGI surface render target does not perform DXGI surface synchronization. To work with Direct2D, the Direct3D device that provides the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/> must be created with the D3D10_CREATE_DEVICE_BGRA_SUPPORT flag.For more information about creating and using DXGI surface render targets, see the {{Direct2D and Direct3D Interoperability Overview}}.When you create a render target and hardware acceleration is available, you allocate resources on the computer's GPU. By creating a render target once and retaining it as long as possible, you gain performance benefits. Your application should create render targets once and hold onto them for the life of the application or until the render target's {{EndDraw}} method returns the {{D2DERR_RECREATE_TARGET}} error. When you receive this error, you need to recreate the render target (and any resources it created).

            <remarks>	
            Drawing operations can only be issued between a {{BeginDraw}} and EndDraw call.BeginDraw and EndDraw are use to indicate that a render target is in use by the Direct2D system. Different implementations of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget"/> might behave differently when {{BeginDraw}} is called. An <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapRenderTarget"/> may be locked between BeginDraw/EndDraw calls, a DXGI surface render target might be acquired on BeginDraw and released on EndDraw, while an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.WindowRenderTarget"/> may begin batching at BeginDraw and may present on EndDraw, for example. The BeginDraw method must be called before rendering operations can be called, though state-setting and state-retrieval operations can be performed even outside of {{BeginDraw}}/EndDraw. After {{BeginDraw}} is called, a render target will normally build up a batch of rendering commands, but defer processing of these commands until either an internal buffer is full, the {{Flush}} method is called, or until EndDraw is called. The EndDraw method causes any batched drawing operations to complete, and then returns an HRESULT indicating the success of the operations and, optionally, the tag state of the render target at the time the error occurred. The EndDraw method always succeeds: it should not be called twice even if a previous EndDraw resulted in a failing HRESULT. If EndDraw is called without a matched call to {{BeginDraw}}, it returns an error indicating that BeginDraw must be called before EndDraw. Calling BeginDraw twice on a render target puts the target into an error state where nothing further is drawn, and returns an appropriate HRESULT and error information when EndDraw is called.	
            </remarks>	
            <returns>If the method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an HRESULT error code and sets tag1 and tag2 to the tags that were active when the error occurred. </returns>

            This method specifies the mapping from pixel space to device-independent space  for the render target.  If both dpiX and dpiY are 0, the factory-read system DPI is chosen. If one parameter is zero and the other unspecified, the DPI is not changed. For <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.WindowRenderTarget"/>, the DPI defaults to the most recently factory-read system DPI. The default value for all other render targets is 96 DPI.

            <remarks>	
            Before you can render with a DC render target, you must use the render target's {{BindDC}} method to associate it with a GDI DC.  Do this for each different DC and whenever there is a change in the size of the area you want to draw to.To enable the DC render target to work with GDI, set the render target's DXGI format to <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.B8G8R8A8_UNorm"/> and alpha mode to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.AlphaMode.Premultiplied"/> or D2D1_ALPHA_MODE_IGNORE.Your application should create render targets once and hold on to them for the life of the application or until the render target's  {{EndDraw}} method returns the {{D2DERR_RECREATE_TARGET}} error. When you receive this error, recreate the render target (and any resources it created).

            <remarks>	
            When you paint with a brush, it paints in the coordinate space of the render target. Brushes do not automatically position themselves to align with the object being painted; by default, they begin painting at the origin (0, 0) of the render target.You can "move" the gradient defined by an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.LinearGradientBrush"/> to a target area by setting its start point and end point. Likewise, you can move the gradient defined by an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RadialGradientBrush"/> by changing its center and radii.To align the content of an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapBrush"/> to the area being painted, you can use the SetTransform method to translate the bitmap to the desired location. This transform only affects the brush; it does not affect any other content drawn by the render target.The following illustrations show the effect of using an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapBrush"/> to fill a rectangle located at (100, 100). The illustration on the left illustration shows the result of filling the rectangle without transforming the brush: the bitmap is drawn at the render target's origin. As a result, only a portion of the bitmap appears in the rectangle.The illustration on the right shows the result of transforming the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapBrush"/> so that its content is shifted 50 pixels to the right and 50 pixels down. The bitmap now fills the rectangle.

            This method specifies the bitmap source that this brush uses to paint. The bitmap is not resized or rescaled automatically to fit the geometry that it fills. The bitmap stays at its native size. To resize or translate the bitmap, use the SetTransform method to apply  a transform to the brush.The native size of a bitmap is the width and height in bitmap pixels, divided by the bitmap DPI. This native size forms the base tile of the brush. To tile a subregion of the bitmap, you must generate a new bitmap containing this subregion and use SetBitmap to apply it to the brush.

            This method gets the interpolation mode of a bitmap, which is specified by the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapInterpolationMode"/> enumeration type.   <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapInterpolationMode.NearestNeighbor"/> represents nearest neighbor filtering. It looks up the bitmap pixel nearest to the current rendering pixel and chooses its exact color. <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapInterpolationMode.Linear"/> represents linear filtering, and  interpolates a color from the four nearest bitmap pixels.The interpolation mode of a bitmap also affects subpixel translations. In a subpixel translation, linear interpolation positions the bitmap more precisely to the application request, but blurs the bitmap in the process.

            The pixel size and DPI of the new render target can be altered by specifying values for desiredSize or desiredPixelSize:  If desiredSize is specified but desiredPixelSize is not, the pixel size is computed from the desired size using the parent target DPI. If the desiredSize maps to a integer-pixel size, the DPI of the compatible render target is the same as the DPI of the parent target.  If desiredSize maps to a fractional-pixel size, the pixel size is rounded up to the nearest integer and the DPI for the compatible render target is slightly higher than the DPI of the parent render target. In all cases, the coordinate (desiredSize.width, desiredSize.height) maps to the lower-right corner of the compatible render target.If the desiredPixelSize is specified and desiredSize is not, the DPI of the new render target is the same as the original render target.If both desiredSize and desiredPixelSize are specified, the DPI of the new render target is computed to account for the difference in scale.If neither desiredSize nor desiredPixelSize is specified, the new render target size and DPI match the original render target.

            <remarks>	
            To write to a Direct3D surface, you obtain an <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/> and pass it to the CreateDxgiSurfaceRenderTarget method to create a DXGI surface render target; you can then use the DXGI surface render target to draw 2-D content to the DXGI surface.A DXGI surface render target is a type of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget"/>. Like other Direct2D render targets, you can use it to create resources and issue drawing commands.The DXGI surface render target and the DXGI surface must use the same DXGI format. If you specify the DXGI_FORMAT_UNKOWN format when you create the render target, it will automatically use the surface's format.The DXGI surface render target does not perform DXGI surface synchronization.For more information about creating and using DXGI surface render targets, see the Direct2D and Direct3D Interoperability Overview.To work with Direct2D, the Direct3D device that provides the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/> must be created with the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.DeviceCreationFlags.BgraSupport"/> flag.When you create a render target and hardware acceleration is available, you allocate resources on the computer's GPU. By creating a render target once and retaining it as long as possible, you gain performance benefits. Your application should create render targets once and hold onto them for the life of the application or until the render target's EndDraw method returns the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.ResultCode.RecreateTarget"/> error. When you receive this error, you need to recreate the render target (and any resources it created).

            When you create a render target and hardware acceleration is available, you allocate resources on the computer's GPU.

When you receive this error, you need to recreate the render target (and any resources it created).

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            A non-zero value generally enables the feature execution, while the zero value disables it. A feature requiring a selector uses this value to indicate the selector index.The OpenType standard provides access to typographic features available in the font by means of a feature tag with the associated parameters. The OpenType feature tag is a 4-byte identifier of the registered name of a feature. For example, the 'kern' feature name tag is used to identify the 'Kerning' feature in OpenType font. Similarly, the OpenType feature tag for 'Standard Ligatures' and 'Fractions' is 'liga' and 'frac' respectively. Since a single run can be associated with more than one typographic features, the Text String API accepts typographic settings for a run as a list of features and are executed in the order they are specified.The value of the tag member represents the OpenType name tag of the feature, while the param value represents additional parameter for the execution of the feature referred by the tag member. Both nameTag and parameter are stored as little endian, the same convention followed by GDI.  Most features treat the Param value as a binary value that indicates whether to turn the execution of the feature on or off, with it being off by default in the majority of cases. Some features, however, treat this value as an integral value representing the integer index to the list of alternate results it may produce during the execution; for instance, the feature 'Stylistic Alternates' or 'salt' uses the parameter value as an index to the list of alternate substituting glyphs it could produce for a specified glyph.

Therefore, ReadFileFragment implementations that rely on internal mutable state must serialize access to such state across multiple threads. For example, an implementation that uses separate Seek and Read operations to read a file fragment must place the code block containing Seek and Read calls under a lock or a critical section.

            This function registers a font file loader with DirectWrite. The font file loader interface, which should be implemented   by a singleton object, handles loading font file resources of a particular type from a key. A given instance can only be registered once. Succeeding attempts will return an error, indicating that it has already been registered. Note that font file loader implementations must not register themselves with DirectWrite inside their constructors, and must not unregister themselves inside their destructors, because registration and unregistraton operations increment and decrement the object reference count respectively. Instead, registration and unregistration with DirectWrite of font file loaders should be performed outside of the font file loader implementation.

            <remarks>	
            Use this structure when creating a render target, or use it with the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget.IsSupported(SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTargetProperties@)"/> method to check the properties supported by an existing render target.As a convenience, Direct2D provides the D2D1::RenderTargetProperties helper function for creating <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTargetProperties"/> structures. An easy way to create a <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTargetProperties"/> structure that works for most render targets is to call the function without specifying any parameters. Doing so creates a <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTargetProperties"/> structure that has its fields set to default values. For more information, see   D2D1::RenderTargetProperties.Not all render targets support hardware rendering. For a list, see the Render Targets Overview.Using Default DPI SettingsTo use the default DPI, set dpiX and dpiY to 0. The default DPI varies depending on the render target:For a compatible render target, the default DPI is the DPI of the parent render target. For a <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.WindowRenderTarget"/>, the default DPI is the system DPI obtained from the render target's <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Factory"/>. For other render targets, the default DPI is 96.To use the default DPI setting, both dpiX and dpiY must be set to 0. Setting only one value to 0 causes an  E_INVALIDARG error when attempting to create a render target.

            <remarks>	
             A single underline can be broken into multiple calls, depending on how the formatting changes attributes. If font sizes/styles change within an underline, the thickness and offset will be averaged weighted according to characters. To get an appropriate starting pixel position, add underline::offset to the baseline. Otherwise there will be no spacing between the text. The x coordinate will always be passed as the left side, regardless of text directionality. This simplifies drawing and reduces the problem of round-off that could potentially cause gaps or a double stamped alpha blend. To avoid alpha overlap, round the end points to the nearest device pixel.

            Note that the mapping from characters to glyphs is, in general, many-to-many.  The recommended estimate for the per-glyph output buffers is (3 * textLength / 2 + 16).  This is not guaranteed to be sufficient. The value of the actualGlyphCount parameter is only valid if the call succeeds.  In the event that maxGlyphCount is not big enough, HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(<see cref="F:SharpDX.Win32.ErrorCode.InsufficientBuffer"/>) will be returned.  The application should  allocate a larger buffer and try again.

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            A cubic Bezier curve is defined by four points: a start point, an end point (point3), and two control points (point1 and point2). A Bezier segment does not contain a property for the starting point of the curve; it defines only the end point. The beginning point of the curve is the current point of the path to which the Bezier curve is added.The two control points of a cubic Bezier curve behave like magnets, attracting portions of what would otherwise be a straight line toward themselves and producing a curve. The first control point, point1, affects the beginning portion of the curve; the second control point, point2, affects the ending portion of the curve.Note??The curve doesn't necessarily pass through either of the control points; each control point moves its portion of the line toward itself, but not through itself.

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            Gradient stops can be specified in any order if they are at different positions. Two stops may share a position. In this case, the first stop specified is treated as the "low" stop (nearer 0.0f) and subsequent stops are treated as "higher" (nearer 1.0f). This behavior is useful if a caller wants an instant transition in the middle of a stop.Typically, there are at least two points in a collection, although creation with only one stop is permitted. For example, one point is at position 0.0f, another point is at position 1.0f, and additional points are distributed in the [0, 1] range. Where the gradient progression is beyond the range of [0, 1], the stops are stored, but may affect the gradient.When drawn, the [0, 1] range of positions is mapped to the brush, in a brush-dependent way. For details, see <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.LinearGradientBrush"/> and <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RadialGradientBrush"/>.Gradient stops with a position outside the [0, 1] range cannot be seen explicitly, but they can still affect the colors produced in the [0, 1] range. For example, a two-stop gradient 0.0f, Black}, {2.0f, White is indistinguishable visually from 0.0f, Black}, {1.0f, Mid-level gray. Also, the colors are clamped before interpolation.

            <remarks>	
            Use this method when creating new <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.LinearGradientBrush"/> objects with the CreateLinearGradientBrush method. For convenience, Direct2D provides the D2D1::LinearGradientBrushProperties helper function for creating new <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.LinearGradientBrushProperties"/> structures.The following illustration shows how a linear gradient changes as you change its start and end points.  For the first gradient, the start point is set to (0,0) and the end point to (150, 50); this creates a diagonal gradient that starts at the upper-left corner and extends to the lower-right corner of the area being painted. When you set the start point to (0, 25) and the end point to (150, 25), a horizontal gradient is created. Similarly, setting the start point  to (75, 0) and the end point to (75, 50) creates a vertical gradient. Setting the start point to  (0, 50) and the end point to (150, 0)  creates a diagonal gradient that starts at the lower-left corner and extends to the upper-right corner of the area being painted.

            <summary>	
            The application calls this function to get a set of hit-test metrics corresponding to a range of text positions. 
            One of the main usages is to implement highlight selection of the text string. 
            The function returns E_NOT_SUFFICIENT_BUFFER, which is equivalent to HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER), 
            when the buffer size of hitTestMetrics is too small to hold all the regions calculated by the function. 
            In this situation, the function sets the output value *actualHitTestMetricsCount to the number of geometries calculated. 
            The application is responsible for allocating a new buffer of greater size and calling the function again. 
            A good value to use as an initial value for maxHitTestMetricsCount may be calculated from the following equation: 
            maxHitTestMetricsCount = lineCount * maxBidiReorderingDepth where lineCount is obtained from the value of the output argument *actualLineCount (from the function IDWriteTextLayout::GetLineLengths), and the maxBidiReorderingDepth value from the DWRITE_TEXT_METRICS structure of the output argument *textMetrics (from the function IDWriteFactory::CreateTextLayout).

            <summary>	
            The application calls this function to get a set of hit-test metrics corresponding to a range of text positions. One of the main usages is to implement highlight selection of the text string. The function returns E_NOT_SUFFICIENT_BUFFER, which is equivalent to HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(<see cref="F:SharpDX.Win32.ErrorCode.InsufficientBuffer"/>), when the buffer size of hitTestMetrics is too small to hold all the regions calculated by the function. In this situation, the function sets the output value *actualHitTestMetricsCount to the number of geometries calculated. The application is responsible for allocating a new buffer of greater size and calling the function again. A good value to use as an initial value for maxHitTestMetricsCount may be calculated from the following equation: maxHitTestMetricsCount = lineCount * maxBidiReorderingDepth where lineCount is obtained from the value of the output argument *actualLineCount (from the function IDWriteTextLayout::GetLineLengths), and the maxBidiReorderingDepth value from the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextMetrics"/> structure of the output argument *textMetrics (from the function <see cref="M:SharpDX.DirectWrite.Factory.CreateTextLayout(System.String,System.Int32,SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextFormat,System.Single,System.Single,SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextLayout)"/>).

        <member name="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.AlphaMode">
            <summary>	
            Specifies how the alpha value of a bitmap or render target should be treated.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            The <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.AlphaMode"/> enumeration is used with the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.PixelFormat"/> enumeration to specify the alpha mode of a render target or bitmap. Different render targets and bitmaps support different alpha modes. For a list, see Supported Pixel Formats and Alpha Modes.The Differences Between Straight and Premultiplied AlphaWhen describing an RGBA color using straight alpha, the alpha value of the color is stored in the alpha channel. For example, to describe a red color that is 60% opaque, you'd use the following values: (255, 0, 0, 255 * 0.6) = (255, 0, 0, 153). The 255 value indicates full red, and 153 (which is 60 percent of 255) indicates that the color should have an opacity of 60 percent.When describing an RGBA color using premultiplied alpha, each color is multiplied by the alpha value: (255 * 0.6, 0 * 0.6, 0 * 0.6, 255 * 0.6) = (153, 0, 0, 153).Regardless of the alpha mode of the render target, D2D1_COLOR_F values are always interpreted as straight alpha.  For example, when specifying the color of an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.SolidColorBrush"/> for use with a bitmap that uses the premultiplied alpha mode, you'd specify the color just as you would if the bitmap used straight alpha. When you paint with the brush, Direct2D translates the color to the destination format for you.Alpha Mode for Render TargetsRegardless of the alpha mode setting, a render target's contents support transparency. For example, if you draw a partially transparent red rectangle with a render target with an alpha mode of <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.AlphaMode.Ignore"/>, the rectangle will appear pink (if the background is white), as you might expect.If you draw a partially transparent red rectangle when the alpha mode is <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.AlphaMode.Premultiplied"/>, the rectangle will appear pink (assuming the background is white) and you can see through it to whatever is behind the render target. This is useful when using a <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.DeviceContextRenderTarget"/> to render to a transparent window or when using an compatible render target (a render targeted created by the CreateCompatibleRenderTarget method) to create a bitmap that supports transparency.ClearType and Alpha ModesIf you specify an alpha mode other than <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.AlphaMode.Ignore"/> for a render target, the text antialiasing mode automatically changes from <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.TextAntialiasMode"/> CLEARTYPE to <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.TextAntialiasMode"/> GRAYSCALE. (When you specify an alpha mode of <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.AlphaMode.Unknown"/>, Direct2D sets the alpha for you depending on the type of render target. For a list of what the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.AlphaMode.Unknown"/> setting resolves to for each render target, see the Supported Pixel Formats and Alpha Modes overview.)You can use the SetTextAntialiasMode method to change the text antialias mode  back to <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.TextAntialiasMode"/> CLEARTYPE, but rendering ClearType text to a transparent surface can create unpredictable results. If you want to render ClearType text to an transparent render target, we recommend that you use one of the following two techniques.Use the PushAxisAlignedClip method to clip the render target to the area where the text will be rendered,    then call the Clear method and specify an opaque color, then render your text. Use DrawRectangle to draw an opaque rectangle behind the area where the text will be rendered.

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            To stretch an image, each pixel in the original image must be mapped to a group of pixels in the larger image. To shrink an image, groups of pixels in the original image must be mapped to single pixels in the smaller image. The effectiveness of the algorithms that perform these mappings determines the quality of a scaled image. Algorithms that produce higher-quality scaled images tend to require more processing time. <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapInterpolationMode.NearestNeighbor"/> provides faster but lower-quality interpolation, while <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapInterpolationMode.Linear"/> provides higher-quality interpolation.

            Specifies whether Direct2D provides synchronization for an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Factory"/> and the resources it creates, so that they may be safely accessed from multiple threads.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            When you create a factory, you can specify whether it is multithreaded or singlethreaded. A singlethreaded factory provides no serialization against any other single threaded instance within Direct2D, so this mechanism provides a very large degree of scaling on the CPU.You can also create a multithreaded factory instance. In this case, the factory and all derived objects can be used from any thread, and each render target can be rendered to independently. Direct2D serializes calls to these objects, so a single multithreaded Direct2D instance won't scale as well on the CPU as many single threaded instances. However, the resources can be shared within the multithreaded instance.Note the qualifier "On the CPU": GPUs generally take advantage of fine-grained parallelism more so than CPUs. For example, multithreaded calls from the CPU might still end up being serialized when being sent to the GPU; however, a whole bank of pixel and vertex shaders will run in parallel to perform the rendering.

            Use the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.FillMode"/> enumeration when creating an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.GeometryGroup"/> with the CreateGeometryGroup method, or when modifying the fill mode of an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.SimplifiedGeometrySink"/> with the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.SimplifiedGeometrySink.SetFillMode(SharpDX.Direct2D1.FillMode)"/> method.Direct2D fills the interior of a path by using one of the two fill modes specified by this enumeration: <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.FillMode.Alternate"/> (alternate) or <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.FillMode.Winding"/> (winding). Because the modes determine how to fill the interior of a closed shape, all shapes are treated as closed when they are filled.  If there is a gap in a segment in a shape, draw an imaginary line to close it.To see the difference between the winding and alternate fill modes, assume that you have four circles with the same center and a different radius, as shown in the following illustration. The first one has the radius of 25, the second 50, the third 75, and the fourth 100.The following  illustration shows the shape filled by using the alternate fill mode. Notice that the center and third ring are not filled. This is because a ray drawn from any point in either of those two rings passes through an even number of segments.The following illustration explains this process.The following illustration shows how the same shape is filled when the winding fill mode is specified.Notice that all the rings are filled. This is because all the segments run in the same direction, so a ray drawn from any point will cross one or more segments, and the sum of the crossings will not equal zero.The following illustration explains this process. The red arrows represent the direction in which the segments are drawn and the black arrow represents an arbitrary ray that runs from a point in the innermost ring. Starting with a value of zero, for each segment that the ray crosses, a value of one is added for every clockwise intersection. All points lie in the fill region in this illustration, because the count does not equal zero.

            <remarks>	
            Interpolating in a linear gamma space (<see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Gamma.Linear"/>) can avoid changes in perceived brightness caused by the effect of gamma correction in spaces where the gamma is not 1.0, such as the default sRGB color space, where the gamma is 2.2. For an example of the differences between these two blending modes, consider the following illustration, which shows two gradients, each of which blends from red to blue to green:The first gradient is interpolated linearly in the space of the render target (sRGB in this case), and one can see the dark bands between each color. The second gradient uses a gamma-correct linear interpolation, and thus does not exhibit the same variations in brightness.

            <remarks>	
            ClearType antialiasing must use the current contents of the render target to blend properly. When a pushed layer requests initializing for ClearType, Direct 2D copies the current contents of the render target into the layer so that ClearType antialiasing can be performed. Rendering ClearType text into a transparent layer does not produce the desired results.A small performance hit from re-copying content occurs when <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget.Clear(System.Nullable{SharpDX.Color4})"/> is called.

            Describes the antialiasing mode used for drawing text.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            This enumeration is used with the SetTextAntialiasMode of an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget"/> to specify how text and glyphs are antialiased.By default, Direct2D renders text in ClearType mode. Factors that  can downgrade the default quality to grayscale or aliased:If the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.RenderingMode"/> value  is <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectWrite.RenderingMode.Aliased"/> , then the  default text antialiasing mode is aliased.  To change the DirectWrite rendering mode of an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget"/>, use the  <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget.SetTextRenderingParams(SharpDX.DirectWrite.RenderingParams)"/> method.  If the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.RenderingMode"/> value is <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectWrite.RenderingMode.Outline"/>, then the default text  antialiasing mode is grayscale. If the render target has an alpha channel and is not set to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.AlphaMode.Ignore"/>, then  the default text antialiasing mode is grayscale. If <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget.PushLayer(SharpDX.Direct2D1.LayerParameters@,SharpDX.Direct2D1.Layer)"/> is called without <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.LayerOptions.InitializeForCleartype"/> (and the corresponding PopLayer has not  been called yet), then the default text  antialiasing mode is grayscale.

            If the window was occluded the last time  EndDraw was called, the next time the render target calls CheckWindowState, it  returns <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.WindowState.Occluded"/> regardless of the current window state.

            <remarks>	
            A DirectWrite factory object contains information about its internal state, such as font loader registration and cached font data. In most cases you should use the shared factory object, because it allows multiple components that use DirectWrite to share internal DirectWrite state information, thereby reducing memory usage. However, there are cases when it is desirable to reduce the impact of a component on the rest of the process, such as a plug-in from an untrusted source,  by sandboxing and isolating it from the rest of the process components. In such cases, you should use an isolated factory for the sandboxed component.

            Represents the style of a font face as normal, italic, or oblique.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            Three terms categorize the slant of a font: normal, italic, and oblique.Font styleDescription NormalThe characters in a normal, or roman, font are upright. 	
             Italic 	
            The characters in an italic font are truly slanted and appear as they were designed. 	
             ObliqueThe characters in an oblique font are artificially slanted.?For Oblique, the slant is achieved by performing a shear transformation on the characters from a normal font. When a true italic font is not available on a computer or printer, an oblique style can be generated from the normal font and used to simulate an italic font.  The following illustration shows the normal, italic, and oblique font styles for the Palatino Linotype font. Notice how the italic font style has a more flowing and visually appealing appearance than the oblique font style, which is simply created by skewing the normal font style version of the text.Note?? Values other than the ones defined in the enumeration are considered to be invalid, and they are rejected by font API functions.

            Represents the density of a typeface, in terms of the lightness or heaviness of the strokes. The enumerated values correspond to the usWeightClass definition in the OpenType specification. The usWeightClass represents an integer value between 1 and 999. Lower values indicate lighter weights; higher values indicate heavier weights.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            Weight differences are generally differentiated by an increased stroke or thickness that is associated with a given character in a typeface, as compared to a "normal" character from that same typeface. 	
            The following illustration shows an example of Normal and UltraBold weights for the Palatino Linotype typeface.Note??Not all weights are available for all typefaces. When a weight is not available for a typeface, the closest matching weight is returned.Font weight values less than 1 or greater than 999 are considered invalid, and they are rejected by font API functions.

             A single underline can be broken into multiple calls, depending on how the formatting changes attributes. If font sizes/styles change within an underline, the thickness and offset will be averaged weighted according to characters. To get an appropriate starting pixel position, add underline::offset to the baseline. Otherwise there will be no spacing between the text. The x coordinate will always be passed as the left side, regardless of text directionality. This simplifies drawing and reduces the problem of round-off that could potentially cause gaps or a double stamped alpha blend. To avoid alpha overlap, round the end points to the nearest device pixel.

            Important??Certain font file types are recognized, but not supported by the font system. For example, the font system will recognize a file as a Type 1 font file but will not be able to construct a font face object from it. In such situations, Analyze will set isSupportedFontType output parameter to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/>.

            <remarks>	
            This function creates a DirectWrite factory object that is used for subsequent creation of individual DirectWrite objects. DirectWrite factory contains internal state data such as font loader registration and cached font data. In most cases it is recommended you use the shared factory object, because it allows multiple components that use DirectWrite to share internal DirectWrite state data, and thereby reduce memory usage. However, there are cases when it is desirable to reduce the impact of a component, such as a plug-in from an untrusted source, on the rest of the process, by sandboxing and isolating it from the rest of the process components. In such cases, it is recommended you use an isolated factory for the sandboxed component.The following example shows how to create a shared DirectWrite factory.<code>	
             if (SUCCEEDED(hr))	
            { hr = <see cref="M:SharpDX.DirectWrite.DWrite.CreateFactory(SharpDX.DirectWrite.FactoryType,System.Guid,SharpDX.ComObject)"/>( <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectWrite.FactoryType.Shared"/>, __uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.Factory"/>), reinterpret_cast&lt;<see cref="T:SharpDX.ComObject"/>**&gt;(&amp;pDWriteFactory_) );	
            }
