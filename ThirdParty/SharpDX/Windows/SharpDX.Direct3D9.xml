This is a good place to re-acquire video-memory resources and capture state blocks.

            <remarks>	
             The Direct3D object is the first Direct3D COM object that your graphical application needs to create and the last object that your application needs to release. Functions for enumerating and retrieving capabilities of a device are accessible through the Direct3D object. This enables applications to select devices without creating them. Create an IDirect3D9 object as shown here: 	
            <code> LPDIRECT3D9 g_pD3D = NULL; if( NULL == (g_pD3D = Direct3DCreate9(D3D_SDK_VERSION))) return E_FAIL; </code>	
            	
             The IDirect3D9 interface supports enumeration of active display adapters and allows the creation of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device"/> objects. If the user dynamically adds adapters (either by adding devices to the desktop, or by hot-docking a laptop), those devices will not be included in the enumeration. Creating a new IDirect3D9 interface will expose the new devices. D3D_SDK_VERSION is passed to this function to ensure that the header files against which an application is compiled match the version of the runtime DLL's that are installed on the machine. D3D_SDK_VERSION is only changed in the runtime when a header change (or other code change) would require an application to be rebuilt. If this function fails, it indicates that the header file version does not match the runtime DLL version. For an example, see {{Creating a Device (Direct3D 9)}}.

            <remarks>	
            If the user's computer provides no special hardware acceleration for 3D operations, your application might emulate 3D hardware in software. Software rasterization devices emulate the functions of color 3D hardware in software. A software device runs more slowly than a hal. However, software devices take advantage of any special instructions supported by the CPU to increase performance. Instruction sets include the AMD 3DNow! instruction set on some AMD processors and the MMX instruction set supported by many Intel processors. Direct3D uses the 3D-Now! instruction set to accelerate transformation and lighting operations and the MMX instruction set to accelerate rasterization.Software devices communicate with Direct3D through an interface similar to the hardware device driver interface (DDI).Software devices are loaded by the application and registered with the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Direct3D"/> object. Direct3D uses the software device for rendering.The Direct3D Driver Development Kit (DDK) provides the documentation and headers for developing pluggable software devices.

            An application supplies a display mode and a format to EnumAdapterModes which returns a display mode. This method could be used in a loop to enumerate all available display modes.The application specifies a format and the enumeration is restricted to those display modes that exactly match the format (alpha is ignored). Allowed formats (which are members of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format"/>) are as follows:<see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format.A1R5G5B5"/> <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format.A2R10G10B10"/> <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format.A8R8G8B8"/> <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format.R5G6B5"/> <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format.X1R5G5B5"/> <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format.X8R8G8B8"/>In addition, EnumAdapterModes treats pixel formats 565 and 555 as equivalent, and returns the correct version. The difference comes into play only when the application locks the back buffer and there is an explicit flag that the application must set in order to accomplish this.

            <remarks>	
            A hal device type requires hardware acceleration. Applications can use CheckDeviceType to determine if the needed hardware and drivers are present to support a hal device.Full-screen applications should not specify a DisplayFormat that contains an alpha channel. This will result in a failed call. Note that an alpha channel can be present in the back buffer but the two display formats must be identical in all other respects. For example, if DisplayFormat = <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format.X1R5G5B5"/>, valid values for BackBufferFormat include <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format.X1R5G5B5"/> and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format.A1R5G5B5"/> but exclude <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format.R5G6B5"/>.The following code fragment shows how you could use CheckDeviceType to test whether a certain device type can be used on this adapter.<code>	
             if(SUCCEEDED(pD3Device-&gt;CheckDeviceType(D3DADAPTER_DEFAULT,  <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.DeviceType.Hardware"/>,  DisplayFormat,  BackBufferFormat,  bIsWindowed))) return <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.Ok"/>;	
            // There is no HAL on this adapter using this render-target format. 	
            // Try again, using another format.	
            	
            </code>This code returns <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.Ok"/> if the device can be used on the default adapter with the specified surface format.Using CheckDeviceType to test for compatibility between a back buffer that differs from the display format will return appropriate values. This means that the call will reflect device capabilities. If the device cannot render to the requested back-buffer format, the call will still return <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ResultCode.NotAvailable"/>. If the device can render to the format, but cannot perform the color-converting presentation, the return value will also be <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ResultCode.NotAvailable"/>. Applications can discover hardware support for the presentation itself by calling CheckDeviceFormatConversion. No software emulation for the color-converting presentation itself will be offered.

               Alpha blending in a pixel shader - Set Usage to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Usage.QueryPostPixelShaderBlending"/>. Expect this to fail for all floating-point render targets. Autogeneration of mipmaps - Set Usage to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Usage.AutoGenerateMipMap"/>. If the mipmap automatic generation fails, the application will get a non-mipmapped texture. Calling this method is considered a hint, so this method can return <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ResultCode.NoAutomaticGeneration"/> (a valid success code) if the only thing that fails is the mipmap generation. For more information about mipmap generation, see Automatic Generation of Mipmaps (Direct3D 9).When migrating code from Direct3D 9 to Direct3D 10, the Direct3D 10 equivalent to CheckDeviceFormat is CheckFormatSupport.

            <remarks>	
            This method is provided to enable applications to work with hardware requiring that certain depth formats can only work with certain render-target formats.The behavior of this method has been changed for DirectX 8.1.  This method now pays attention to the D24x8 and D32 depth-stencil formats. The previous version assumed that these formats would always be usable with 32- or 16-bit render targets. This method will now return <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ResultCode.Success"/> for these formats only if the device is capable of mixed-depth operations.The following code fragment shows how you could use CheckDeviceFormat to validate a depth stencil format.<code>

            <remarks>	
            Using CheckDeviceType to test for compatibility between a back buffer that differs from the display format will return appropriate values. This means that the call will reflect device capabilities. If the device cannot render to the requested back buffer format, the call will still return <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ResultCode.NotAvailable"/>. If the device can render to the format, but cannot perform the color-converting presentation, the return value will also be <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ResultCode.NotAvailable"/>. Applications can discover hardware support for the presentation itself by calling CheckDeviceFormatConversion. No software emulation for the color-converting presentation itself will be offered.CheckDeviceFormatConversion can also be used to determine which combinations of source surface formats and destination surface formats are permissible in calls to StretchRect.Color conversion is restricted to the following source and target formats.The source format must be a FOURCC format or a valid back buffer format. For a list of these, see FourCC Formats and BackBuffer or Display Formats. The target format must be one of these unsigned formats:  D3DFMT_X1R5G5B5D3DFMT_A1R5G5B5D3DFMT_R5G6B5 D3DFMT_R8G8B8D3DFMT_X8R8G8B8D3DFMT_A8R8G8B8 D3DFMT_A2R10G10B10D3DFMT_A16B16G16R16D3DFMT_A2B10G10R10 D3DFMT_A8B8G8R8D3DFMT_X8B8G8R8D3DFMT_A16B16G16R16F <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format.A32B32G32R32F"/>  <para>?</para>

            <remarks>	
            This method returns a fully working device interface, set to the required display mode (or windowed), and allocated with the appropriate back buffers. To begin rendering, the application needs only to create and set a depth buffer (assuming EnableAutoDepthStencil is <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/> in <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters"/>).When you create a Direct3D device, you supply two different window parameters: a focus window (hFocusWindow) and a device window (the hDeviceWindow in <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters"/>). The purpose of each window is:The focus window alerts Direct3D when an application switches from foreground mode to background mode (via Alt-Tab, a mouse click, or some other method). A single focus window is shared by each device created by an application. The device window determines the location and size of the back buffer on screen. This is used by Direct3D when the back buffer contents are copied to the front buffer during Present.This method should not be run during the handling of WM_CREATE. An application should never pass a window handle to Direct3D while handling WM_CREATE.  Any call to create, release, or reset the device must be done using the same thread as the window procedure of the focus window.Note that <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.CreateFlags.HardwareVertexProcessing"/>, <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.CreateFlags.MixedVertexProcessing"/>, and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.CreateFlags.SoftwareVertexProcessing"/> are mutually exclusive flags, and at least one of these vertex processing flags must be specified when calling this method.Back buffers created as part of the device are only lockable if <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentFlags.LockableBackBuffer"/> is specified in the presentation parameters. (Multisampled back buffers and depth surfaces are never lockable.)The methods Reset, <see cref="T:SharpDX.ComObject"/>, and TestCooperativeLevel must be called from the same thread that used this method to create a device.D3DFMT_UNKNOWN can be specified for the windowed mode back buffer format when calling CreateDevice, Reset, and CreateAdditionalSwapChain. This means the application does not have to query the current desktop format before calling CreateDevice for windowed mode. For full-screen mode, the back buffer format must be specified.If you attempt to create a device on a 0x0 sized window, CreateDevice will fail.

            The <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Direct3DEx"/> object is the first object that the application creates and the last object thta the application releases. Functions for enumerating and retrieving capabilities of a device are accessible through the IDirect3D9Ex object. This enables applications to select devices without creating them.   The <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Direct3DEx"/> interface supports enumeration of active display adapters and allows the creation of IDirect3D9Ex objects. If the user dynamically adds adapters (either by adding devices to the desktop, or by hot-docking a laptop), these devices are not included in the enumeration. Creating a new IDirect3D9Ex interface will expose the new devices.   Pass the D3D_SDK_VERSION flag to this function to ensure that header files used in the compiled application match the version of the installed runtime DLLs. D3D_SDK_VERSION is changed in the runtime only when a header or another code change would require rebuilding the application. If this function fails, it indicates that the versions of the header file and the runtime DLL do not match.  Note??Direct3DCreate9Ex is supported only in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and Windows 7.   Earlier versions of the D3D9.dll library do not include Direct3D9Ex and Direct3DCreate9Ex.

            Events such as display mode changes on other heads of the same hardware, monitor change or its connection status change, and desktop extension/unextension could all affect the number of display mode available.To fullscreen applications, <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ResultCode.PresentModeChanged"/> returned from PresentEx or CheckDeviceState is the indication of display mode setting failure due to those events.To increase the chance of setting a currently available display mode successfully, fullscreen applications should try to requery the available display mode list upon receiving <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ResultCode.PresentModeChanged"/>.

            GetAdapterDisplayModeEx does not return the correct format when the display is in an extended format, such as 2:10:10:10. Instead, it returns the format X8R8G8B8.To windowed applications, a value of <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ResultCode.PresentModeChanged"/> returned from PresentEx or CheckDeviceState indicates that the display mode changed and that the current display mode might have a different format. To avoid a color-converting Present blt, windowed applications can optionally get new display mode information by using this method and adjusting its swap chain format accordingly. This method returns <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ResultCode.NotAvailable"/> if this head is no longer part of the desktop or if the monitor is disconnected.

            <remarks>	
            This method applies to the following interfaces, which inherit from <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.BaseTexture"/>.<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.CubeTexture"/>   <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Texture"/>   <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.VolumeTexture"/>   <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Resource"/>SetLOD is used for level-of-detail control of managed textures. This method returns 0 on nonmanaged textures.SetLOD communicates to the Direct3D texture manager the most detailed mipmap in the chain that should be loaded into local video memory. For example, in a five-level mipmap chain, setting LODNew to 2 indicates that the texture manager should load only mipmap levels 2 through 4 into local video memory at any given time.More specifically, if the texture was created with the dimensions of 256x256, setting the most detailed level to 0 indicates that 256 x 256 is the largest mipmap available, setting the most detailed level to 1 indicates that 128 x 128 is the largest mipmap available, and so on, up to the most detailed mip level (the smallest texture size) for the chain.

            <remarks>	
            For performance reasons, dirty regions are only recorded for level zero of a texture. For sublevels, it is assumed that the corresponding (scaled) box is also dirty. Dirty regions are automatically recorded when LockBox is called without <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.LockFlags.NoDirtyUpdate"/> or <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.LockFlags.ReadOnly"/>.Using <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.LockFlags.NoDirtyUpdate"/> and explicitly specifying dirty regions can be used to increase the efficiency of UpdateTexture. Using this method, applications can optimize what subset of a resource is copied by specifying dirty boxes on the resource. However, the dirty regions may be expanded to optimize alignment.

             As a general rule, do not hold a lock across more than one frame. When working with vertex buffers, you are allowed to make multiple lock calls; however, you must ensure that the number of lock calls match the number of unlock calls. DrawPrimitive calls will not succeed with any outstanding lock count on any currently set vertex buffer. The D3DLOCK_DISCARD and D3DLOCK_NOOVERWRITE flags are valid only on buffers created with D3DUSAGE_DYNAMIC.

            As a general rule, do not hold a lock across more than one frame. When working with vertex buffers, you are allowed to make multiple lock calls; however, you must ensure that the number of lock calls match the number of unlock calls. DrawPrimitive calls will not succeed with any outstanding lock count on any currently set vertex buffer.The <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.LockFlags.Discard"/> and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.LockFlags.NoOverwrite"/> flags are valid only on buffers created with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Usage.Dynamic"/>.For information about using <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.LockFlags.Discard"/> or <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.LockFlags.NoOverwrite"/> with <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.VertexBuffer.Lock_(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.IntPtr@,SharpDX.Direct3D9.LockFlags)"/>, see Using Dynamic Vertex and Index Buffers.

            <remarks>	
            To use D3DXMACROs in more than one line, prefix each new line character with a backslash (like a #define in the C language). For example:<code>	
             sample=	
            macro.Name = "DO_CODE_BLOCK";	
            macro.Definition = "/* here is a block of code */\\\n" "{ do something ... }\\\n";	
            	
            </code>Notice the 3 backslash characters at the end of the line. The first two are required to output a single '\', followed by the newline character "\n". Optionally, you may also want to terminate your lines using "\\\r\n".

            An application sets one active technique in the effect system by calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Effect.Begin"/>. The effect system responds by capturing all the pipeline state that can be changed by the technique in a state block. An application signals the end of a technique by calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Effect.End"/>, which uses the state block to restore the original state. The effect system, therefore, takes care of saving state when a technique becomes active and restoring state when a technique ends. If you choose to disable this save and restore functionality, see <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.FX.DoNotSaveSamplerState"/>.Within the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Effect.Begin"/> and <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Effect.End"/> pair, an application uses <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Effect.BeginPass(System.Int32)"/> to set the active pass, <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Effect.CommitChanges"/> if any state changes occurred after the pass was activated, and <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Effect.EndPass"/> to end the active pass.

            SetRawValue is a very fast way to set effect constants since it performs a memory copy without performing validation or any data conversion (like converting a row-major matrix to a column-major matrix). Use SetRawValue to set a series of contiguous effect constants. For instance, you could set an array of twenty matrices with 20 calls to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.BaseEffect.SetMatrix(SharpDX.Direct3D9.EffectHandle,SharpDX.Matrix@)"/> or by using a single SetRawValue.All values are expected to be either matrix4x4s or float4s and all matrices are expected to be in column-major order. Int or float values are cast into a float4; therefore, it is highly recommended that you use SetRawValue with only float4 or matrix4x4 data.

This will happen with a constant appears in more than one Register_Set but does not have space in that register set allocated.Because a sampler can appear more than once in a constant table, this method can return an array of descriptions, each one with a different register index.

            <summary>	
            Defines the window dimensions of a render-target surface onto which a 3D volume projects.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            The X, Y, Width, and Height members describe the position and dimensions of the viewport on the render-target surface. Usually, applications render to the entire target surface; when rendering on a 640 x 480 surface, these members should be 0, 0, 640, and 480, respectively. The MinZ and MaxZ are typically set to 0.0 and 1.0 but can be set to other values to achieve specific effects. For example, you might set them both to 0.0 to force the system to render objects to the foreground of a scene, or both to 1.0 to force the objects into the background.When the viewport parameters for a device change (because of a call to the SetViewport method), the driver builds a new transformation matrix.

            An attribute table is used to identify areas of the mesh that need to be drawn with different textures, render states, materials, and so on.  In addition, the application can use the attribute table to hide portions of a mesh by not drawing a given attribute identifier (AttribId) when drawing the frame.The LPD3DXATTRIBUTERANGE type is defined as a reference to the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.AttributeRange"/> structure.<code>

            This structure describes how a simplification operation will consider vertex data when calculating relative costs between collapsing edges.  For example, if the Normal field is 0.0, the simplification operation will ignore the vertex normal component when calculating the error for the collapse.  However, if the Normal field is 1.0, the simplification operation will use the vertex normal component. If the Normal field is 2.0, double the amount of errors;  if the Normal field is 4.0, then quadruple the number of errors, and so on.The LPD3DXATTRIBUTEWEIGHTS type is defined as a reference to the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.AttributeWeights"/> structure.<code>

            Describes the current clip status.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            When clipping is enabled during vertex processing (by ProcessVertices, DrawPrimitive, or other drawing functions), Direct3D computes a clip code for every vertex. The clip code is a combination of D3DCS_* bits. When a vertex is outside a particular clipping plane, the corresponding bit is set in the clipping code. Direct3D maintains the clip status using <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ClipStatus"/>, which has ClipUnion and ClipIntersection members. ClipUnion is a bitwise OR of all vertex clip codes and ClipIntersection is a bitwise AND of all vertex clip codes. Initial values are zero for ClipUnion and 0xFFFFFFFF for ClipIntersection. When <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.RenderState.Clipping"/> is set to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/>, ClipUnion and ClipIntersection are set to zero. Direct3D updates the clip status during drawing calls. To compute clip status for a particular object, set ClipUnion and ClipIntersection to their initial value and continue drawing.Clip status is not updated by DrawRectPatch and DrawTriPatch because there is no software emulation for them.

            <summary>	
            Describes swapchain statistics relating to PresentEx calls.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            When a 9Ex application adopts Flip Mode present (<see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.SwapEffect.FlipEx"/>), applications can detect frame dropping by calling GetPresentStatistics  at any point in time.  In effect, they can do the following.Render to the back buffer Call Present Call GetPresentStats and store the resulting <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentationStatistics"/> structure Render the next frame to the back buffer Call Present Repeat steps 4 and 5 one or more times Call GetPresentStats and store the resulting <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentationStatistics"/> structure  Compare the values of PresentRefreshCount from the two stored <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentationStatistics"/> structures.  The application can calculate the corresponding PresentRefreshCount of a particular PresentCount parameter based on the assumptions of  PresentRefreshCount increment and PresentCount assignment of frame presents.  If the PresentRefreshCount last sampled does not  match the PresentCount (i.e. if the PresentRefreshCount has incremented but PresentCount has not, then there was frame dropping.)Applications can determine whether a frame has been dropped by sampling any two instances of PresentCount and  GetPresentStats (by calling GetPresentStats API at any two points in time). For example, a media application that is presenting at the same rate  as the monitor refresh rate (for example, monitor refresh rate is 60Hz, the application presents a frame every 1/60 seconds) wants to present  frames A, B, C, D, E, each corresponding to Present IDs (PresentCount) 1, 2, 3, 7, 8.The application code looks like the following sequence.Render frame A to the back buffer Call Present, PresentCount = 1 Call GetPresentStats and store the resulting <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentationStatistics"/> structure Render the next 4 frames, B, C, D, E, respectively Call Present 4 times, PresentCounts = 2, 3, 7, 8, respectively Call GetPresentStats and store the resulting <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentationStatistics"/> structure  Compare the values of PresentRefreshCount from the two stored <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentationStatistics"/> structures.   If the difference is 2, i.e. 2 vblank intervals has elapsed between the two GetPresentStats API calls,  then the last presented frame should be frame C.  Because the application presents once very vblank interval (the refresh rate of the monitor),  the time elapsed between when frame A is presented and when frame C is presented should be 2 vblanks.   Compare the values of PresentCount from the two stored <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentationStatistics"/> structures.   If the first PresentCount is 1 (corresponding to frame A) and the second PresentCount is 3 (corresponding to frame C),  then no frames have been dropped.  If the second PresentCount is 3, which corresponds to frame D,  then the application knows that one frame has been dropped.Note that GetPresentStatistics will be processed after it is called, regardless of the state of FLIPEX mode PresentEx  calls.Windows?Vista:??The Present calls will be queued and then processed before GetPresentStats  call will be processed.When an application detects that the presentation of certain frames are behind, it can skip those frames and correct the presentation to  re-synchronize with the vblank.  To do this, an application can simply not render the late frames and start rendering with the next correct frame  in the queue.  However, if an application has already started the rendering of late frames, it can use a new Present parameter in D3D9Ex called <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Present.ForceImmediate"/>.  The flag will be passed in the parameters of Present API call and indicates to the runtime that the frame  will be processed immediately within the next vblank interval, effectively not visible on screen at all.  Here is the application usage example  after the last step in the previous example.Render the next frame to the back buffer Discover from PresentRefreshCount that the next frame is already late Set Present interval to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Present.ForceImmediate"/> Call Present on the next frameApplications can synchronize video and audio streams in the same manner because the behavior of GetPresentStatistics  does not change in that scenario.D3D9Ex Flip Mode provides frame statistics information to windowed applications and full screen 9Ex applications.Windows?Vista:??Use the DWM APIs for retrieving present statistics.When Desktop Window Manager is turned off, windowed mode 9Ex applications using flip mode will receive present statistics information of  limited accuracy.Windows?Vista:??<para>If an application is not fast enough to keep up with the monitor's refresh rate, possibly due to slow hardware or lack of system resources,  then it can experience a graphics glitch. A glitch is a so-called visual hiccup. If a monitor is set to refresh at 60 Hz, and the application  can only manage 30 fps, then half of the frames will have glitches.</para>	
             <para>Applications can detect a glitch by keeping track of SynchRefreshCount. For example, an application might perform the following sequence of actions.</para>	
              Render to the back buffer. Call Present.  Call GetPresentStats and store the resulting <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentationStatistics"/> structure.  Render the next frame to the back buffer.  Call Present.  Call GetPresentStats and store the resulting <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentationStatistics"/> structure. Compare the values of SyncRefreshCount from the two stored <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentationStatistics"/> structures.  If the difference is greater than one, then a frame was skipped.

            The following diagram identifies the parameters that specify a rectangle patch.Each of the vertices in the vertex buffer is shown as a black dot. In this case, the vertex buffer has 20 vertices in it, 16 of which are in the rectangle patch. The stride is the number of vertices in the width of the vertex buffer, in this case five. The x offset to the first vertex is called the StartIndexVertexWidth and is in this case 1. The y offset to the first patch vertex is called the StartIndexVertexHeight and is in this case 0.To render a stream of individual rectangular patches (non-mosaic), you should interpret your geometry as a long narrow (1 x N) rectangular patch. The <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.RectanglePatchInfo"/> structure for such a strip (cubic B?zier) would be set up in the following manner.<code>	
             <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.RectanglePatchInfo"/> RectInfo; RectInfo.Width = 4;	
            RectInfo.Height = 4;	
            RectInfo.Stride = 4;	
            RectInfo.Basis = <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Basis.Bezier"/>;	
            RectInfo.Order = D3DORDER_CUBIC;	
            RectInfo.StartVertexOffsetWidth = 0;	
            RectInfo.StartVertexOffsetHeight = 4*i;  // The variable i is the index of the 	
            //   patch you want to render.

            Helper structure for managing a shader constant table. This can also be done using <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ConstantTable"/>.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            Shader constant information is included in a tab-delimited table of comments.  All offsets are measured in bytes from the beginning of the structure.  Entries in the constant table are sorted by Creator in ascending order.A shader constant table can be managed with the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ConstantTable"/> interfaces.  Alternatively, you can manage the constant table with <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ShaderConstanttable"/>.This size member is often initialized using the following:<code>	
             <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ShaderConstanttable"/> constantTable;	
            constantTable.Size = sizeof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ShaderConstanttable"/>)

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            DirectX 8.1 versions only.The Direct3D runtime calls a driver's D3dGetDriverState function to obtain vertex-cache information from the driver. In this D3dGetDriverState call, the runtime specifies the D3DDEVINFOID_VCACHE flag in the dwFlags member of the DD_GETDRIVERSTATEDATA structure that the runtime passes. The driver specifies vertex-cache information in a <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.VCache"/> structure and returns it at the lpdwStates member of DD_GETDRIVERSTATEDATA.DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.The Direct3D runtime specifies D3DDP2OP_CREATEQUERY and D3DDP2OP_ISSUEQUERY commands in calls to the driver's D3dDrawPrimitives2 callback to create driver-side resources for the query and then to asynchronously query the driver for vertex-cache information. In the call with the D3DDP2OP_CREATEQUERY command, the runtime specifies the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.QueryType.VCache"/> query type in the QueryType member of the D3DHAL_DP2CREATEQUERY structure.When the driver completes a vertex-cache query, the driver sets the total size of the response buffer in the dwErrorOffset member of the D3DHAL_DRAWPRIMITIVES2DATA structure and sets the ddrval member of D3DHAL_DRAWPRIMITIVES2DATA to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ResultCode.Success"/> for successful completion. The driver also overwrites the incoming command buffer with the outgoing response buffer. This response buffer contains a D3DHAL_DP2RESPONSEQUERY structure that identifies a response for the vertex-cache query. This D3DHAL_DP2RESPONSEQUERY is followed by the vertex-cache data in the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.VCache"/> structure.

Rendering clear-type fonts would normally require two passes. To eliminate the second pass, a pixel shader can be used to output two colors, which we can call PSOutColor[0] and PSOutColor[1]. The first color would contain the standard 3 color components (RGB). The second color would contain 3 alpha components (one for each component of the first color).These new blending modes are only used for text rendering on the first render target.

To support vertex and index buffers, create the device in <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool.SystemMemory"/> memory.If D3dref9.dll is installed, Direct3D will use the reference rasterizer to create a <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.DeviceType.Reference"/> device type, even if <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.DeviceType.NullReference"/> is specified. If D3dref9.dll is not available and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.DeviceType.NullReference"/> is specified, Direct3D will neither render nor present the scene.

            Defines the various types of surface formats.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            There are several types of formats:BackBuffer Buffer DXTn Floating-Point FOURCC IEEE Mixed Signed Unsigned Other ConstantAll formats are listed from left to right, most-significant bit to least-significant bit. For example, D3DFORMAT_ARGB is ordered from the most-significant bit channel A (alpha), to the least-significant bit channel B (blue). When traversing surface data, the data is stored in memory from least-significant bit to most-significant bit, which means that the channel order in memory is from least-significant bit (blue) to most-significant bit (alpha).The default value for formats that contain undefined channels (G16R16, A8, and so on) is 1. The only exception is the A8 format, which is initialized to 000 for the three color channels.The order of the bits is from the most significant byte first, so <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format.A8L8"/> indicates that the high byte of this 2-byte format is alpha. <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format.D16"/> indicates a 16-bit integer value and an application-lockable surface.Pixel formats have been chosen to enable the expression of hardware-vendor-defined extension formats, as well as to include the well-established FOURCC method. The set of formats understood by the Direct3D runtime is defined by <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format"/>.Note that formats are supplied by independent hardware vendors (IHVs) and many FOURCC codes are not listed. The formats in this enumeration are unique in that they are sanctioned by the runtime, meaning that the reference rasterizer will operate on all these types. IHV-supplied formats will be supported by the individual IHVs on a card-by-card basis.BackBuffer or Display FormatsThese formats are the only valid formats for a back buffer or a display.FormatBack bufferDisplay A2R10G10B10xx (full-screen mode only) A8R8G8B8x X8R8G8B8xx A1R5G5B5x X1R5G5B5xx R5G6B5xx?Buffer FormatsDepth, stencil, vertex, and index buffers each have unique formats.Buffer flagsValueFormat D3DFMT_D16_LOCKABLE7016-bit z-buffer bit depth. D3DFMT_D327132-bit z-buffer bit depth. D3DFMT_D15S17316-bit z-buffer bit depth where 15 bits are reserved for the depth channel and 1 bit is reserved for the stencil channel. D3DFMT_D24S87532-bit z-buffer bit depth using 24 bits for the depth channel and 8 bits for the stencil channel. D3DFMT_D24X87732-bit z-buffer bit depth using 24 bits for the depth channel. D3DFMT_D24X4S47932-bit z-buffer bit depth using 24 bits for the depth channel and 4 bits for the stencil channel. D3DFMT_D32F_LOCKABLE82A lockable format where the depth value is represented as a standard IEEE floating-point number. D3DFMT_D24FS883A non-lockable format that contains 24 bits of depth (in a 24-bit floating point format - 20e4) and 8 bits of stencil. D3DFMT_D32_LOCKABLE84A lockable 32-bit depth buffer.	
            Differences between Direct3D 9 and Direct3D 9Ex:??This flag is available in Direct3D 9Ex only.  D3DFMT_S8_LOCKABLE84A lockable 8-bit stencil buffer.	
            Differences between Direct3D 9 and Direct3D 9Ex:??This flag is available in Direct3D 9Ex only.  D3DFMT_D168016-bit z-buffer bit depth. D3DFMT_VERTEXDATA100Describes a vertex buffer surface. D3DFMT_INDEX1610116-bit index buffer bit depth. D3DFMT_INDEX3210232-bit index buffer bit depth.?All depth-stencil formats except <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format.D16Lockable"/> indicate no particular bit ordering per pixel, and the driver is allowed to consume more than the indicated number of bits-per-depth channel (but not stencil channel).DXTn Compressed Texture FormatsThese flags are used for compressed textures:DXTn Compressed Texture flagsValueFormat D3DFMT_DXT1MAKEFOURCC('D', 'X', 'T', '1')DXT1 compression texture format  D3DFMT_DXT2MAKEFOURCC('D', 'X', 'T', '2')DXT2 compression texture format  D3DFMT_DXT3MAKEFOURCC('D', 'X', 'T', '3')DXT3 compression texture format  D3DFMT_DXT4MAKEFOURCC('D', 'X', 'T', '4')DXT4 compression texture format  D3DFMT_DXT5MAKEFOURCC('D', 'X', 'T', '5')DXT5 compression texture format?The runtime will not allow an application to create a surface using a DXTn format unless the surface dimensions are multiples of 4.  This applies to offscreen-plain surfaces, render targets, 2D textures, cube textures, and volume textures.Floating-Point FormatsThese flags are used for floating-point surface formats. These 16-bits-per-channel formats are also known as s10e5 formats.Floating-point flagsValueFormat D3DFMT_R16F11116-bit float format using 16 bits for the red channel. D3DFMT_G16R16F11232-bit float format using 16 bits for the red channel and 16 bits for the green channel. D3DFMT_A16B16G16R16F11364-bit float format using 16 bits for the each channel (alpha, blue, green, red).?FOURCC FormatsData in a FOURCC format is compressed data.MAKEFOURCCA macro for generating four-character codes follows:#define MAKEFOURCC(ch0, ch1, ch2, ch3)                              \ ((DWORD)(BYTE)(ch0) | ((DWORD)(BYTE)(ch1) &lt;&lt; 8) |   \ ((DWORD)(BYTE)(ch2) &lt;&lt; 16) | ((DWORD)(BYTE)(ch3) &lt;&lt; 24 ))Here are the defined FOURCC formats:FOURCC flagsValueFormat D3DFMT_MULTI2_ARGB8MAKEFOURCC('M','E','T','1')MultiElement texture (not compressed) D3DFMT_G8R8_G8B8MAKEFOURCC('G', 'R', 'G', 'B')A 16-bit packed RGB format analogous to YUY2 (Y0U0, Y1V0, Y2U2, and so on). It requires a pixel pair in order to properly represent the color value. The first pixel in the pair contains 8 bits of green (in the high 8 bits) and 8 bits of red (in the low 8 bits). The second pixel contains 8 bits of green (in the high 8 bits) and 8 bits of blue (in the low 8 bits). Together, the two pixels share the red and blue components, while each has a unique green component (G0R0, G1B0, G2R2, and so on). The texture sampler does not normalize the colors when looking up into a pixel shader; they remain in the range of 0.0f to 255.0f. This is true for all programmable pixel shader models. For the fixed function pixel shader, the hardware should normalize to the 0.f to 1.f range and essentially treat it as the YUY2 texture. Hardware that exposes this format must have the PixelShader1xMaxValue member of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Capabilities"/> set to a value capable of handling that range. D3DFMT_R8G8_B8G8MAKEFOURCC('R', 'G', 'B', 'G')A 16-bit packed RGB format analogous to UYVY (U0Y0, V0Y1, U2Y2, and so on). It requires a pixel pair in order to properly represent the color value. The first pixel in the pair contains 8 bits of green (in the low 8 bits) and 8 bits of red (in the high 8 bits). The second pixel contains 8 bits of green (in the low 8 bits) and 8 bits of blue (in the high 8 bits). Together, the two pixels share the red and blue components, while each has a unique green component (R0G0, B0G1, R2G2, and so on).

            <remarks>	
            Functions that begin with D3DXLoadxxx support all of the formats listed. Functions that begin with D3DXSavexxx support all of the formats listed except the Truevision (.tga) and portable pixmap (.ppm) formats.The following table lists the available input and output formats.File ExtensionDescription .bmpWindows bitmap format. Contains a header that describes the resolution of the device on which the rectangle of pixels was created, the dimensions of the rectangle, the size of the array of bits, a logical palette, and an array of bits that defines the relationship between pixels in the bitmapped image and entries in the logical palette. .ddsDirectDraw Surface file format. Stores textures, volume textures, and cubic environment maps, with or without mipmap levels, and with or without pixel compression. See DDS. .dibWindows DIB. Contains an array of bits combined with structures that specify width and height of the bitmapped image, color format of the device where the image was created, and resolution of the device used to create that image. .hdrHDR format. Encodes each pixel as an RGBE 32-bit color, with 8 bits of mantissa for red, green, and blue, and a shared 8-bit exponent. Each channel is separately compressed with run-length encoding (RLE). .jpgJPEG standard. Specifies variable compression of 24-bit RGB color and 8-bit gray-scale Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) image document files. .pfmPortable float map format. A raw floating point image format, without any compression. The file header specifies image width, height, monochrome or color, and machine word order. Pixel data is stored as 32-bit floating point values, with 3 values per pixel for color, and one value per pixel for monochrome. .pngPNG format. A non-proprietary bitmap format using lossless compression. .ppmPortable Pixmap format. A binary or ASCII file format for color images that includes image height and width and the maximum color component value. .tgaTarga or Truevision Graphics Adapter format. Supports depths of 8, 15, 16, 24, and 32 bits, including 8-bit gray scale, and contains optional color palette data, image (x, y) origin and size data, and pixel data.?See Types of Bitmaps for more information on some of these formats.

            <remarks>	
            In addition to enabling full-scene multisampling at <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.Reset(SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters[])"/> time, there will be render states that turn various aspects on and off at fine-grained levels.Multisampling is valid only on a swap chain that is being created or reset with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.SwapEffect.Discard"/> swap effect.The multisample antialiasing value can be set with the parameters (or sub-parameters) in the following methods.MethodParametersSub-parameters  <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Direct3D.CheckDeviceMultiSampleType_(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.DeviceType,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format,System.Boolean,SharpDX.Direct3D9.MultisampleType,System.Int32@)"/> MultiSampleType and pQualityLevels  <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Direct3D.CreateDevice(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.DeviceType,System.IntPtr,SharpDX.Direct3D9.CreateFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters[],SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device)"/> pPresentationParametersMultiSampleType and pQualityLevels  <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.CreateAdditionalSwapChain(SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters@,SharpDX.Direct3D9.SwapChain)"/> pPresentationParametersMultiSampleType and pQualityLevels  <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.CreateDepthStencilSurface(System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format,SharpDX.Direct3D9.MultisampleType,System.Int32,System.Boolean,System.IntPtr)"/> MultiSampleType and pQualityLevels  <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.CreateRenderTarget(System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format,SharpDX.Direct3D9.MultisampleType,System.Int32,System.Boolean,System.IntPtr)"/> MultiSampleType and pQualityLevels  <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.Reset(SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters[])"/> pPresentationParametersMultiSampleType and pQualityLevels?It is not good practice to switch from one multisample type to another to raise the quality of the antialiasing.D3DMULTISAMPLE_NONE enables swap effects other than discarding, locking, and so on.Whether the display device supports maskable multisampling (more than one sample for a multiple-sample render-target format plus antialias support) or just non-maskable multisampling (only antialias support), the driver for the device provides the number of quality levels for the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.MultisampleType.NonMaskable"/> multiple-sample type. Applications that just use multisampling for antialiasing purposes only need to query for the number of non-maskable multiple-sample quality levels that the driver supports.The quality levels supported by the device can be obtained with the pQualityLevels parameter of <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Direct3D.CheckDeviceMultiSampleType_(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.DeviceType,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format,System.Boolean,SharpDX.Direct3D9.MultisampleType,System.Int32@)"/>. Quality levels used by the application are set with the MultiSampleQuality parameter of <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.CreateDepthStencilSurface(System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format,SharpDX.Direct3D9.MultisampleType,System.Int32,System.Boolean,System.IntPtr)"/> and <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.CreateRenderTarget(System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format,SharpDX.Direct3D9.MultisampleType,System.Int32,System.Boolean,System.IntPtr)"/>.See <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.RenderState.MultisampleMask"/> for discussion of maskable multisampling.

            Defines whether the current tessellation mode is discrete or continuous.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            Note that continuous tessellation produces a completely different tessellation pattern from the discrete one for the same tessellation values (this is more apparent in wireframe mode). Thus, 4.0 continuous is not the same as 4 discrete.

(Managed resources are restored by the runtime.) This is especially beneficial for unified memory architecture (UMA) systems. Other dynamic resources are not a good match for <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool.Managed"/>. In fact, index buffers and vertex buffers cannot be created using <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool.Managed"/> together with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Usage.Dynamic"/>.For dynamic textures, it is sometimes desirable to use a pair of video memory and system memory textures, allocating the video memory using <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool.Default"/> and the system memory using <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool.SystemMemory"/>. You can lock and modify the bits of the system memory texture using a locking method. Then you can update the video memory texture using <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.UpdateTexture(SharpDX.Direct3D9.BaseTexture,SharpDX.Direct3D9.BaseTexture)"/>.

            <para>Resources are placed in the memory pool most appropriate for the set of usages requested for the given resource. This is usually video memory, including both local video memory and AGP memory. The <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool.Default"/> pool is separate from <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool.Managed"/> and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool.SystemMemory"/>, and it specifies that the resource is placed in the preferred memory for device access. Note that <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool.Default"/> never indicates that either <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool.Managed"/> or <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool.SystemMemory"/> should be chosen as the memory pool type for this resource. Textures placed in the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool.Default"/> pool cannot be locked unless they are dynamic textures or they are private, FOURCC, driver formats. To access unlockable textures, you must use functions such as <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.UpdateSurface(SharpDX.Direct3D9.Surface,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Surface)"/>, <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.UpdateTexture(SharpDX.Direct3D9.BaseTexture,SharpDX.Direct3D9.BaseTexture)"/>, <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.GetFrontBufferData(System.Int32)"/>, and <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.GetRenderTargetData(SharpDX.Direct3D9.Surface,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Surface)"/>. <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool.Managed"/> is probably a better choice than <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool.Default"/> for most applications. Note that some textures created in driver-proprietary pixel formats, unknown to the Direct3D runtime, can be locked. Also note that - unlike textures - swap chain back buffers, render targets, vertex buffers, and index buffers can be locked.

They perform similarly to COPY_VSYNC in that there is only one present per frame, and they prevent tearing with beam-following. In contrast, <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentInterval.Immediate"/> will attempt to provide an unlimited presentation rate.Full-screen mode supports similar usage as windowed mode by supporting <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentInterval.Immediate"/> regardless of the refresh rate or swap effect. <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentInterval.Default"/> uses the default system timer resolution whereas the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentInterval.One"/> calls timeBeginPeriod to enhance system timer resolution. This improves the quality of vertical sync, but consumes slightly more processing time. Both parameters attempt to synchronize vertically.

            The <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.RenderState"/> enumerated type lists a variety of attributes, or render states. The enumerators of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.RenderState"/> that are used exclusively by drivers can specify either rendering information or a texture attribute. The following render states are used by display drivers:	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            The driver uses these render states when it performs graphics rendering. Only render states that are specific to drivers are included in the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) documentation. The render states accessible to DirectX applications are included in the DirectX SDK documentation. These application-level render states include such characteristics as whether alpha blending is enabled, whether dithering is enabled, whether Direct3D lighting is used, and the type of shading to be used.To update a particular render state, Direct3D stores information about the render state, and then calls the driver's D3dDrawPrimitives2 callback routine. The information provided to the driver enables it to:<para>Determine that it should update one or more render states.</para>	
               <para>Identify which render states to update, and what the new render state values should be.</para>Note that for certain render states to be honored, the driver must have previously set capability flags in the relevant member of the D3DPRIMCAPS structure.In order to indicate a specific render state update, Direct3D inserts a D3DHAL_DP2COMMAND structure into the command buffer, setting the bCommand member of this structure to D3DDP2OP_RENDERSTATE (see the description for D3DDP2OP_RENDERSTATE in D3DHAL_DP2OPERATION), and setting the wStateCount member of the same structure to the number of render states to be updated.Immediately following the D3DHAL_DP2COMMAND structure, Direct3D inserts one D3DHAL_DP2RENDERSTATE structure into the command buffer for each render state to be updated. The RenderState member of this structure identifies the render state to be changed; the new value of this render state is specified in either the dwState member (for DWORD values) or the fState member (for D3DVALUE values).The following figure shows a portion of the command buffer containing a D3DDP2OP_RENDERSTATE command and two D3DHAL_DP2RENDERSTATE structures. The first of the three structures indicates that two render states are to be updated. The second structure indicates that the D3DRENDERSTATE_FILLMODE render state is to be changed to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.FillMode.Solid"/>. The third structure indicates that the D3DRENDERSTATE_SHADEMODE render state should be updated to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ShadeMode.Gouraud"/>.Additional NotesSee the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.TextureStage"/>, <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.TextureOperation"/>, and D3DTEXTUREFILTER enumerated types in the DirectX SDK documentation for complete listings of all of the enabled render state types.Some changes have been made to the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.RenderState"/> enumerated type for DirectX 5.0 and beyond. D3DRENDERSTATE_BLENDENABLE has been removed completely although it is defined as D3DRENDERSTATE_ALPHABLENDENABLE in the d3dtypes.h header file. See D3DRENDERSTATE_COLORKEYENABLE for an explanation. The 128 integer values in the interval [128, 255] are reserved for texture coordinate wrap flags. These are constructed with the D3DWRAP_U and D3DWRAP_V macros. Using a flags word preserves forward compatibility with texture coordinates of higher dimension than 2D.Multitexture macro ops and D3DRENDERSTATE_TEXTUREFACTOR override all of the per-texture stage blending controls (COLOR{OP,ARG1,ARG2} &amp; ALPHA{OP,ARG1,ARG2}).

            <summary>	
            Defines swap effects.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            The state of the back buffer after a call to Present is well-defined by each of these swap effects, and whether the Direct3D device was created with a full-screen swap chain or a windowed swap chain has no effect on this state. In particular, the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.SwapEffect.Flip"/> swap effect operates the same whether windowed or full-screen, and the Direct3D runtime guarantees this by creating extra buffers. As a result, it is recommended that applications use <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.SwapEffect.Discard"/> whenever possible to avoid any such penalties. This is because this swap effect will always be the most efficient in terms of memory consumption and performance.Applications that use <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.SwapEffect.Flip"/> or <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.SwapEffect.Discard"/> should not expect full-screen destination alpha to work. This means that the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.RenderState.DestinationBlend"/> render state will not work as expected because full-screen swap chains with these swap effects do not have an explicit pixel format from the driver's point of view. The driver infers that they should take on the display format, which does not have an alpha channel. To work around this, take the following steps:Use <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.SwapEffect.Copy"/>. Check the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Caps3.AlphaFullScreenFlipOrDiscard"/> flag in the Caps3 member of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Capabilities"/> structure. This flag indicates whether the driver can do alpha blending when <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.SwapEffect.Flip"/> or <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.SwapEffect.Discard"/> is used. Applications using flip mode swap effect (<see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.SwapEffect.FlipEx"/>) should call PresentEx after a window resize or region change to ensure that the display content is updated.An invisible window cannot receive user-mode events; furthermore, an invisible-fullscreen window will interfere with the presentation of another applications' windowed-mode window. Therefore, each application needs to ensure that a device window is visible when a swapchain is presented in fullscreen mode.

Unfortunately, meeting this guarantee can involve substantial video memory or processing overheads, especially when implementing flip semantics for a windowed swap chain or copy semantics for a full-screen swap chain. An application may use the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.SwapEffect.Discard"/> swap effect to avoid these overheads and to enable the display driver to select the most efficient presentation technique for the swap chain. This is also the only swap effect that may be used when specifying a value other than <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.MultisampleType.None"/> for the MultiSampleType member of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters"/>.</para>

             <para>For a full-screen swap chain, the runtime uses a combination of flip operations and copy operations, supported if necessary by hidden back buffers, to accomplish the Present operation. Accordingly, the presentation is synchronized with the display adapter's vertical retrace and its rate is constrained by the chosen presentation interval.

            <para>Designates when an application is adopting flip mode, during which time an application's frame is passed instead of copied to the Desktop Window Manager(DWM) for composition when the application is presenting in windowed mode. Flip mode allows an application to more efficiently use memory bandwidth as well as enabling an application to take advantage of full-screen-present statistics. Flip mode does not affect full-screen behavior. A sample application that uses <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Present.ForceImmediate"/> and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.SwapEffect.FlipEx"/> is the D3D9ExFlipEx sample on the MSDN Code Gallery.</para>

            Defines texture filtering modes for a texture stage.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            D3DTEXTUREFILTERTYPE is used by <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.SetSamplerState(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.SamplerState,SharpDX.Direct3D9.TextureFilter)"/> along with <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.SamplerState"/> to define texture filtering modes for a texture stage.To check if a format supports texture filter types other than <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.TextureFilter.Point"/> (which is always supported), call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Direct3D.CheckDeviceFormat_(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.DeviceType,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.ResourceType,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format)"/> with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Usage.QueryFilter"/>.Set a texture stage's magnification filter by calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.SetSamplerState(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.SamplerState,SharpDX.Direct3D9.TextureFilter)"/> with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.SamplerState.MagFilter"/> value as the second parameter and one member of this enumeration as the third parameter.Set a texture stage's minification filter by calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.SetSamplerState(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.SamplerState,SharpDX.Direct3D9.TextureFilter)"/> with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.SamplerState.MinFilter"/> value as the second parameter and one member of this enumeration as the third parameter.Set the texture filter to use between-mipmap levels by calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.SetSamplerState(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.SamplerState,SharpDX.Direct3D9.TextureFilter)"/> with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.SamplerState.MipFilter"/> value as the second parameter and one member of this enumeration as the third parameter.Not all valid filtering modes for a device will apply to volume maps. In general, <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.TextureFilter.Point"/> and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.TextureFilter.Linear"/> magnification filters will be supported for volume maps. If <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.TextureCaps.MipVolumeMap"/> is set, then the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.TextureFilter.Point"/> mipmap filter and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.TextureFilter.Point"/> and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.TextureFilter.Linear"/> minification filters will be supported for volume maps. The device may or may not support the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.TextureFilter.Linear"/> mipmap filter for volume maps. Devices that support anisotropic filtering for 2D maps do not necessarily support anisotropic filtering for volume maps. However, applications that enable anisotropic filtering will receive the best available filtering (probably linear) if anisotropic filtering is not supported.

            Texture coordinates can be transformed using a 4 x 4 matrix before the results are passed to the rasterizer. The texture coordinate transforms are set by calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.SetTextureStageState(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.TextureStage,SharpDX.Direct3D9.TextureArgument)"/>, and by passing in the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.TextureStage.TextureTransformFlags"/> texture stage state and one of the values from <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.TextureTransform"/>. For more information about texture transforms, see Texture Coordinate Transformations (Direct3D 9).

            As many as three flags can be set. Flags in the range 0x00 through 0x04 (D3DBUSTYPE_Xxx) provide the basic bus type. Flags in the range 0x10000 through 0x50000 (D3DBUSIMPL_MODIFIER_Xxx) modify the basic description. The driver sets one bus-type flag, and can set zero or one modifier flag. If the driver sets a modifier flag, it also sets the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.VideoSubType.NonStandard"/> flag. Flags are combined with a bitwise OR.

            <remarks>	
             This method returns a fully working device interface, set to the required display mode (or windowed), and allocated with the appropriate back buffers. To begin rendering, the application needs only to create and set a depth buffer (assuming EnableAutoDepthStencil is FALSE in <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters"/>). When you create a Direct3D device, you supply two different window parameters: a focus window (hFocusWindow) and a device window (the hDeviceWindow in <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters"/>). The purpose of each window is:  The focus window alerts Direct3D when an application switches from foreground mode to background mode (via Alt-Tab, a mouse click, or some other method). A single focus window is shared by each device created by an application. The device window determines the location and size of the back buffer on screen. This is used by Direct3D when the back buffer contents are copied to the front buffer during {{Present}}.  This method should not be run during the handling of WM_CREATE. An application should never pass a window handle to Direct3D while handling WM_CREATE.  Any call to create, release, or reset the device must be done using the same thread as the window procedure of the focus window. Note that D3DCREATE_HARDWARE_VERTEXPROCESSING, D3DCREATE_MIXED_VERTEXPROCESSING, and D3DCREATE_SOFTWARE_VERTEXPROCESSING are mutually exclusive flags, and at least one of these vertex processing flags must be specified when calling this method. Back buffers created as part of the device are only lockable if D3DPRESENTFLAG_LOCKABLE_BACKBUFFER is specified in the presentation parameters. (Multisampled back buffers and depth surfaces are never lockable.) The methods {{Reset}}, <see cref="T:SharpDX.ComObject"/>, and {{TestCooperativeLevel}} must be called from the same thread that used this method to create a device. D3DFMT_UNKNOWN can be specified for the windowed mode back buffer format when calling CreateDevice, {{Reset}}, and {{CreateAdditionalSwapChain}}. This means the application does not have to query the current desktop format before calling CreateDevice for windowed mode. For full-screen mode, the back buffer format must be specified. If you attempt to create a device on a 0x0 sized window, CreateDevice will fail.

If BehaviorFlags specifies {{D3DCREATE_ADAPTERGROUP_DEVICE}}, pPresentationParameters is an array. Regardless of the number of heads that exist, only one depth/stencil surface is automatically created. For Windows 2000 and Windows XP, the full-screen device display refresh rate is set in the following order:   User-specified nonzero ForcedRefreshRate registry key, if supported by the device. Application-specified nonzero refresh rate value in the presentation parameter. Refresh rate of the latest desktop mode, if supported by the device. 75 hertz if supported by the device. 60 hertz if supported by the device. Device default.  An unsupported refresh rate will default to the closest supported refresh rate below it.  For example, if the application specifies 63 hertz, 60 hertz will be used. There are no supported refresh rates below 57 hertz. pPresentationParameters is both an input and an output parameter. Calling this method may change several members including:  If BackBufferCount, BackBufferWidth, and BackBufferHeight  are 0 before the method is called, they will be changed when the method returns. If BackBufferFormat equals <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format.Unknown"/> before the method is called, it will be changed when the method returns.  </param>

            <returns>If the method succeeds, the return value is <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ResultCode.Success"/>, indicating that the device is operational and the calling application can continue.

This would be the case, for example, when a full-screen device has lost focus. If an application detects a lost device, it should pause and periodically call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.TestCooperativeLevel"/> until it receives a return value of <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ResultCode.DeviceNotReset"/>. The application may then attempt to reset the device by calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.Reset(SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters[])"/> and, if this succeeds, restore the necessary resources and resume normal operation. Note that <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.Present"/> will return <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ResultCode.DeviceLost"/> if the device is either "lost" or "not reset".A call to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.TestCooperativeLevel"/> will fail if called on a different thread than that used to create the device being reset.

            The returned value is rounded to the nearest MB. This is done to reflect the fact that video memory estimates are never precise due to alignment and other issues that affect consumption by certain resources. Applications can use this value to make gross estimates of memory availability to make large-scale resource decisions such as how many levels of a mipmap to attempt to allocate, but applications cannot use this value to make small-scale decisions such as if there is enough memory left to allocate another resource.

            <remarks>	
            An operating system cursor is created and used under either of these conditions:The hardware has set <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.CursorCaps.Color"/> (see <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.CursorCaps"/>), and the cursor size is 32x32 (which is the cursor size in the operating system). The application is running in windowed mode.Otherwise, DirectX uses an emulated cursor. An application uses <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.SetCursorPosition(SharpDX.DrawingPoint,System.Boolean)"/> to move an emulated cursor to follow mouse movement.It is recommended for applications to always trap WM_MOUSEMOVE events and call DXSetCursorPosition.Direct3D cursor functions use either GDI cursor or software emulation, depending on the hardware. Users typically want to respond to a WM_SETCURSOR message. For example, they might want to write the message handler as follows:<code>	
             case WM_SETCURSOR:	
            // Turn off window cursor. 	
            SetCursor( <c>null</c> );	
            m_pd3dDevice-&gt;ShowCursor( TRUE );	
            return TRUE; // Prevent Windows from setting cursor to window class cursor.	
            break;	
            	
            </code>Or, users might want to call the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.SetCursorProperties(SharpDX.DrawingPoint,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Surface)"/> method if they want to change the cursor.The application can determine what hardware support is available for cursors by examining appropriate members of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Capabilities"/> structure. Typically, hardware supports only 32x32 cursors and, when windowed, the system might support only 32x32 cursors. In this case, <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.SetCursorProperties(SharpDX.DrawingPoint,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Surface)"/> still succeeds but the cursor might be reduced to that size. The hot spot is scaled appropriately.The cursor does not survive when the device is lost. This method must be called after the device is reset.

Refer to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.TestCooperativeLevel"/> and Lost Devices (Direct3D 9) for further information concerning the use of <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.Reset(SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters[])"/> in the context of lost devices.Calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.Reset(SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters[])"/> causes all texture memory surfaces to be lost, managed textures to be flushed from video memory, and all state information to be lost. Before calling the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.Reset(SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters[])"/> method for a device, an application should release any explicit render targets, depth stencil surfaces, additional swap chains, state blocks, and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool.Default"/> resources associated with the device.There are two different types of swap chains: full-screen or windowed. If the new swap chain is full-screen, the adapter will be placed in the display mode that matches the new size.Direct3D 9 applications can expect messages to be sent to them during this call (for example, before this call is returned); applications should take precautions not to call into Direct3D at this time. In addition, when <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.Reset(SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters[])"/> fails, the only valid methods that can be called are <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.Reset(SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters[])"/>, <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.TestCooperativeLevel"/>, and the various Release member functions. Calling any other method can result in an exception.A call to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.Reset(SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters[])"/> will fail if called on a different thread than that used to create the device being reset.Pixel shaders and vertex shaders survive <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.Reset(SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters[])"/> calls for Direct3D 9. They do not need to be re-created explicitly by the application.<see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format.Unknown"/> can be specified for the windowed mode back buffer format when calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Direct3D.CreateDevice(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.DeviceType,System.IntPtr,SharpDX.Direct3D9.CreateFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters[],SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device)"/>, <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.Reset(SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters[])"/>, and <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.CreateAdditionalSwapChain(SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters@,SharpDX.Direct3D9.SwapChain)"/>. This means the application does not have to query the current desktop format before calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Direct3D.CreateDevice(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.DeviceType,System.IntPtr,SharpDX.Direct3D9.CreateFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters[],SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device)"/> for windowed mode. For full-screen mode, the back buffer format must be specified. Setting BackBufferCount equal to zero  (BackBufferCount = 0) results in one back buffer.When trying to reset more than one display adapter in a group, set pPresentationParameters to point to an array of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters"/> structures, one for each display in the adapter group.If a multihead device was created with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.CreateFlags.AdapterGroupDevice"/>, <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.Reset(SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters[])"/> requires an array of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters"/> structures wherein each structure must specify a full-screen display. To switch back to windowed mode, the application must destroy the device and re-create a non-multihead device in windowed mode.

If SetDialogBoxMode succeeds in a windowed mode application, any subsequent reset to full-screen mode will be checked against the restrictions listed above.

If a calibrator is not installed, the ramp will be passed directly to the device.</para>   <para>D3DSGR_NO_CALIBRATION</para>  <para>No gamma correction is applied.

            <remarks>	
            There is always at least one swap chain (the implicit swap chain) for each device, because Direct3D 9 has one swap chain as a property of the device. The gamma ramp takes effect immediately; there is no wait for a vertical sync.If the device does not support gamma ramps in the swap chain's current presentation mode (full-screen or windowed), no error return is given. Applications can check the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Caps2.FullScreenGamma"/> and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Caps2.CanCalibrateGamma"/> capability bits in the Caps2 member of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Capabilities"/> structure to determine the capabilities of the device and whether a calibrator is installed.For windowed gamma correction presentation, use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.SwapChain.Present(SharpDX.Direct3D9.Present)"/> if the hardware supports the feature. In DirectX 8, SetGammaRamp will set the gamma ramp only on a full-screen mode application. For more information about gamma correction, see Gamma (Direct3D 9).

For example, an application could pass a GDI system memory bitmap reference and get a Direct3D texture interface around it.  Using a system memory  reference with CreateTexture has the following restrictions.The pitch of the texture must be equal to the width multiplied by the number of bytes per pixel. Only textures with a single mipmap level are supported.  The Levels argument must be 1. The Pool argument must be <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool.SystemMemory"/>. The pSharedHandle argument must be a valid reference to a buffer that can hold the system memory point; *pSharedHandle must  be a valid reference to system memory with a size in bytes of texture width * texture height * bytes per pixel of the texture format.

            <remarks>	
            A vertex buffer can be used with either hardware or software vertex processing. This is determined by how the device and the vertex buffer are created.When a device is created, CreateDevice uses the behavior flag to determine whether to process vertices in hardware or software. There are three possibilities:Process vertices in hardware by setting <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.CreateFlags.HardwareVertexProcessing"/>. Process vertices in software by setting <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.CreateFlags.SoftwareVertexProcessing"/>. Process vertices in either hardware or software by setting <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.CreateFlags.MixedVertexProcessing"/>.Mixed-mode devices might need to switch between software and hardware processing (using <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.SetSoftwareVertexProcessing(System.Boolean)"/>) after the device is created.When a vertex buffer is created, CreateVertexBuffer uses the usage parameter to decide whether to process vertices in hardware or software.If CreateDevice uses <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.CreateFlags.HardwareVertexProcessing"/>, CreateVertexBuffer must use 0. If CreateDevice uses <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.CreateFlags.SoftwareVertexProcessing"/>, CreateVertexBuffer must use either 0 or <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Usage.SoftwareProcessing"/>. For either value, vertices will be processed in software. If CreateDevice uses <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.CreateFlags.MixedVertexProcessing"/>, CreateVertexBuffer can use either 0 or <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Usage.SoftwareProcessing"/>.To use a vertex buffer with a mixed mode device, create a single vertex buffer which can be used for both hardware or software processing. Use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.SetStreamSource(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.VertexBuffer,System.Int32,System.Int32)"/> to set the current vertex buffer and use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.SetRenderState(SharpDX.Direct3D9.RenderState,System.Boolean)"/>, if necessary, to change the device behavior to match. It is recommended that the vertex buffer usage matches the device behavior. Note that a vertex buffer created for software processing cannot be located in video memory.The <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device"/> interface supports rendering of primitives using vertex data stored in vertex buffer objects. Vertex buffers are created from the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device"/>, and are usable only with the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device"/> object from which they are created.When set to a nonzero value, which must be a valid FVF code, the FVF parameter indicates that the buffer content is to be characterized by an FVF code. A vertex buffer that is created with an FVF code is referred to as an FVF vertex buffer. For more information, see FVF Vertex Buffers (Direct3D 9).Non-FVF buffers can be used to interleave data during multipass rendering or multitexture rendering in a single pass. To do this, one buffer contains geometry data and the others contain texture coordinates for each texture to be rendered. When rendering, the buffer containing the geometry data is interleaved with each of the buffers containing the texture coordinates. If FVF buffers were used instead, each of them would need to contain identical geometry data in addition to the texture coordinate data specific to each texture rendered. This would result in either a speed or memory penalty, depending on the strategy used. For more information about texture coordinates, see Texture Coordinates (Direct3D 9).

            <remarks>	
            Index buffers are memory resources used to hold indices, they are similar to both surfaces and vertex buffers. The use of index buffers enables Direct3D to avoid unnecessary data copying and to place the buffer in the optimal memory type for the expected usage.To use index buffers, create an index buffer, lock it, fill it with indices, unlock it, pass it to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.SetIndices(SharpDX.Direct3D9.IndexBuffer)"/>, set up the vertices, set up the vertex shader, and call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.DrawIndexedPrimitive(SharpDX.Direct3D9.PrimitiveType,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32)"/> for rendering.The MaxVertexIndex member of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Capabilities"/> structure indicates the types of index buffers that are valid for rendering.

            <remarks>	
            You can dirty a portion of a texture by locking it, or by calling one of the following methods.<see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.CubeTexture.AddDirtyRectangle(SharpDX.Direct3D9.CubeMapFace)"/>   <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Texture.AddDirtyRectangle"/>   <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.VolumeTexture.AddDirtyBox"/>   <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.UpdateSurface(SharpDX.Direct3D9.Surface,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Surface)"/>IDirect3DDevice9::UpdateTexture retrieves the dirty portions of the texture by calculating what has been accumulated since the last update operation.For performance reasons, dirty regions are only recorded for level zero of a texture. For sublevels, it is assumed that the corresponding (scaled) rectangle or box is also dirty. Dirty regions are automatically recorded when LockRect or <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.VolumeTexture.LockBox(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.LockFlags)"/> is called without <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.LockFlags.NoDirtyUpdate"/> or <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.LockFlags.ReadOnly"/>. Also, the destination surface of <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.UpdateSurface(SharpDX.Direct3D9.Surface,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Surface)"/> is marked dirty.This method fails if the textures are of different types, if their bottom-level buffers are of different sizes, or if their matching levels do not match. For example, consider a six-level source texture with the following dimensions.<code>	
             32x16, 16x8, 8x4, 4x2, 2x1, 1x1	
            	
            </code>This six-level source texture could be the source for the following one-level destination.<code>	
             1x1	
            	
            </code>For the following two-level destination.<code>	
             2x1, 1x1	
            	
            </code>Or, for the following three-level destination.<code>	
             4x2, 2x1, 1x1	
            	
            </code>In addition, this method will fail if the textures are of different formats. If the destination texture has fewer levels than the source, only the matching levels are copied. If the source texture has fewer levels than the destination, the method will fail.If the source texture has dirty regions, the copy can be optimized by restricting the copy to only those regions. It is not guaranteed that only those bytes marked dirty will be copied.Here are the possibilities for source and destination surface combinations:If pSourceTexture is a non-autogenerated mipmap and pDestinationTexture is an autogenerated mipmap, only the topmost matching level is updated, and the destination sublevels are regenerated. All other source sublevels are ignored. If both pSourceTexture and pDestinationTexture are autogenerated mipmaps, only the topmost matching level is updated. The sublevels from the source are ignored and the destination sublevels are regenerated. If pSourceTexture is an autogenerated mipmap and pDestinationTexture a non-autogenerated mipmap, UpdateTexture will fail.

            <remarks>	
            StretchRect RestrictionsDriver support varies. See the section on driver support (below) to see which drivers support which source and destination formats. The source and destination surfaces must be created in the default memory pool. If filtering is specified, you must set the appropriate filter caps (see StretchRectFilterCaps in <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Capabilities"/>). Stretching is not supported between source and destination rectangles on the same surface. Stretching is not supported if the destination surface is an off-screen plain surface but the source is not. You many not stretch between source and destination rectangles if either surface is in a compressed format (see Using Compressed Textures (Direct3D 9)). Stretching supports color-space conversion from YUV to high-precision RGBA only. Since color conversion support is not supported by software emulation, use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Direct3D.CheckDeviceFormatConversion_(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.DeviceType,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format)"/> to test the hardware for color conversion support. If the source or destination surface is a texture surface (or a cube texture surface), you must use a Direct3D 9 driver that supports <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.DeviceCaps2.CanStretchRectFromTextures"/> (see <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.DeviceCaps2"/>).Additional Restrictions for Depth and Stencil SurfacesThe source and destination surfaces must be plain depth stencil surfaces (not textures) (see <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.CreateDepthStencilSurface(System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format,SharpDX.Direct3D9.MultisampleType,System.Int32,System.Boolean,System.IntPtr)"/>). Neither of the surfaces can be discardable. The entire surface must be copied (that is: sub-rectangle copies are not allowed). Format conversion, stretching, and shrinking are not supported. StretchRect cannot be called inside of a BeginScene/EndScene pair.Using StretchRect to downsample a Multisample RendertargetYou can use StretchRect to copy from one rendertarget to another. If the source rendertarget is multisampled, this results in downsampling the source rendertarget. For instance you could:Create a multisampled rendertarget. Create a second rendertarget of the same size, that is not multisampled. Copy (using StretchRect the multisample rendertarget to the second rendertarget.Note that use of the extra surface involved in using StretchRect to downsample a Multisample Rendertarget will result in a performance hit.Driver SupportThere are many restrictions as to which surface combinations are valid for StretchRect. Factors include whether the driver is a Direct3D 9 driver or older, and whether the operation will result in stretching/shrinking.  Since applications are not expected to recognize if the driver is a Direct3D 9 driver or not, the runtime will automatically set a new cap, <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.DeviceCaps2.CanStretchRectFromTextures"/> cap (see <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.DeviceCaps2"/>), for Direct3D 9-level drivers and above.DirectX 8 Driver (no stretching) Dest formats TextureRT textureRTOff-screen plain Src formatsTextureNoNoNoNo RT textureNoYesYesNo RTNoYesYesNo Off-screen plainYesYesYesYes?DirectX 8 Driver (stretching) Dest formats TextureRT textureRTOff-screen plain Src formatsTextureNoNoNoNo RT textureNoNoNoNo RTNoYesYesNo Off-screen plainNoYesYesNo?Direct3D 9 Driver (no stretching) Dest formats TextureRT textureRTOff-screen plain Src formatsTextureNoYesYesNo RT textureNoYesYesNo RTNoYesYesNo Off-screen plainNoYesYesYes?Direct3D 9 Driver (stretching) Dest formats TextureRT textureRTOff-screen plain Src formatsTextureNoYesYesNo RT textureNoYesYesNo RTNoYesYesNo Off-screen plainNoYesYesNo?

            The device can support multiple render targets. The number of render targets supported by a device is contained in the NumSimultaneousRTs member of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Capabilities"/>. See Multiple Render Targets (Direct3D 9).Setting a new render target will cause the viewport (see Viewports and Clipping (Direct3D 9)) to be set to the full size of the new render target.Some hardware tests the compatibility of the depth stencil buffer with the color buffer. If this is done, it is only done in a debug build.Restrictions for using this method include the following:The multisample type must be the same for the render target and the depth stencil surface. The formats must be compatible for the render target and the depth stencil surface. See <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Direct3D.CheckDepthStencilMatch_(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.DeviceType,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format)"/>. The size of the depth stencil surface must be greater than or equal to the size of the render target.These restrictions are validated only when using the debug runtime when any of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device"/> Draw methods are called.Cube textures differ from other surfaces in that they are collections of surfaces. To call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.SetRenderTarget(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Surface)"/> with a cube texture, you must select an individual face using <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.CubeTexture.GetCubeMapSurface(SharpDX.Direct3D9.CubeMapFace,System.Int32)"/> and pass the resulting surface to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.SetRenderTarget(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Surface)"/>.

            Typically, methods that return state will not work on a device that is created using <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.CreateFlags.PureDevice"/>. This method however, will work even on a pure device because it returns an interface.The device can now support multiple render targets. The number of render targets supported by a device is contained in the NumSimultaneousRTs member of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Capabilities"/>. See Multiple Render Targets (Direct3D 9).Calling this method will increase the internal reference count on the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Surface"/> interface. Failure to call IUnknown::Release when finished using the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Surface"/> interface results in a memory leak.

The  <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.SetLight(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Light@)"/> method accepts the index at which the device should place the set of light properties to its internal list of light properties, and the address of a prepared <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Light"/> structure that defines those properties. You can call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.SetLight(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Light@)"/> with new information as needed to update the light's illumination properties.The system allocates memory to accommodate a set of lighting properties each time you call the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.SetLight(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Light@)"/> method with an index that has never been assigned properties. Applications can set a number of lights, with only a subset of the assigned lights enabled at a time. Check the MaxActiveLights member of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Capabilities"/> structure when you retrieve device capabilities to determine the maximum number of active lights supported by that device. If you no longer need a light, you can disable it or overwrite it with a new set of light properties.The following example prepares and sets properties for a white point-light whose emitted light will not attenuate over distance.<code>

If the values in the array at pPlane were labeled A, B, C, and D in the order that they appear in the array, they would fit into the general plane equation so that Ax + By + Cz + Dw = 0. A point with homogeneous coordinates (x, y, z, w) is visible in the half space of the plane if Ax + By + Cz + Dw &gt;= 0. Points that exist behind the clipping plane are clipped from the scene.When the fixed function pipeline is used the plane equations are assumed to be in world space. When the programmable pipeline is used the plane equations are assumed to be in the clipping space (the same space as output vertices).This method does not enable the clipping plane equation being set. To enable a clipping plane, set the corresponding bit in the DWORD value applied to the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.RenderState.ClipPlaneEnable"/> render state.

            Clip status is used during software vertex processing. Therefore, this method is not supported on pure or nonpure hardware processing devices. For more information about pure devices, see <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.CreateFlags"/>.When clipping is enabled during vertex processing (by <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.ProcessVertices(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.VertexBuffer,SharpDX.Direct3D9.VertexDeclaration,SharpDX.Direct3D9.LockFlags)"/>, <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.DrawPrimitives(SharpDX.Direct3D9.PrimitiveType,System.Int32,System.Int32)"/>, or other drawing functions), Direct3D computes a clip code for every vertex. The clip code is a combination of D3DCS_* bits. When a vertex is outside a particular clipping plane, the corresponding bit is set in the clipping code. Direct3D maintains the clip status using <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ClipStatus"/>, which has ClipUnion and ClipIntersection members. ClipUnion is a bitwise "OR" of all vertex clip codes and ClipIntersection is a bitwise "AND" of all vertex clip codes. Initial values are zero for ClipUnion and 0xFFFFFFFF for ClipIntersection. When <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.RenderState.Clipping"/> is set to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/>, ClipUnion and ClipIntersection are set to zero. Direct3D updates the clip status during drawing calls. To compute clip status for a particular object, set ClipUnion and ClipIntersection to their initial value and continue drawing.Clip status is not updated by <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.DrawRectanglePatch(System.Int32,System.Single[])"/> and <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.DrawTrianglePatch(System.Int32,System.Single[])"/> because there is no software emulation for them.

            <remarks>	
            The <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.ValidateDevice(System.Int32)"/> method should be used to validate scenarios only when other capabilities are deficient. For example, in a multistage texturing scenario, you could query the MaxTextureBlendStages and MaxSimultaneousTextures members of a <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Capabilities"/> structure to determine if multistage texturing is possible on the device.Current hardware does not necessarily implement all possible combinations of operations and arguments. You can determine whether a particular blending operation can be performed with given arguments by setting the desired blending operation, and then calling the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.ValidateDevice(System.Int32)"/> method.The <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.ValidateDevice(System.Int32)"/> method uses the current render states, textures, and texture-stage states to perform validation at the time of the call. Changes to these factors after the call invalidate the previous result, and the method must be called again before rendering a scene.For best performance, call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.ValidateDevice(System.Int32)"/> at initialization time; do not use it within a render loop.Using diffuse iterated values, either as an argument or as an operation (D3DTA_DIFFUSED3DTOP_BLENDDIFFUSEALPHA) is rarely supported on current hardware. Most hardware can introduce iterated color data only at the last texture operation stage.Try to specify the texture (<see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.TextureArgument.Texture"/>) for each stage as the first argument, rather than the second argument.Many cards do not support use of diffuse or scalar values at arbitrary texture stages. Often, these are available only at the first or last texture-blending stage.Many cards do not have a blending unit associated with the first texture that is capable of more than replicating alpha to color channels or inverting the input. Therefore, your application might need to use only the second texture stage, if possible. On such hardware, the first unit is presumed to be in its default state, which has the first color argument set to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.TextureArgument.Texture"/> with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.TextureOperation.SelectArg1"/> operation.Operations on the output alpha that are more intricate than or substantially different from the color operations are less likely to be supported.Some hardware does not support simultaneous use of <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.TextureArgument.TFactor"/> and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.TextureArgument.Diffuse"/>.Many cards do not support simultaneous use of multiple textures and mipmapped trilinear filtering. If trilinear filtering has been requested for a texture involved in multitexture blending operations and validation fails, turn off trilinear filtering and revalidate. In this case, you might want to perform multipass rendering instead.

            The restrictions for changing modes are as follows:If a device is created with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.CreateFlags.SoftwareVertexProcessing"/>, the vertex processing will be done in software and cannot be changed. If a device is created with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.CreateFlags.HardwareVertexProcessing"/>, the vertex processing will be done in hardware and cannot be changed. If a device is created with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.CreateFlags.MixedVertexProcessing"/>, the vertex processing will be done in hardware by default. The processing can be switched to software (or back to hardware) using <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.SetSoftwareVertexProcessing(System.Boolean)"/>.An application can create a mixed-mode device to use both the software vertex processing and the hardware vertex processing. To switch between the two vertex processing modes in DirectX 8.x, use IDirect3DDevice8::SetRenderState with the render state D3DRS_SOFTWAREVERTEXPROCESSING and the appropriate DWORD argument. The drawback of the render state approach was the difficulty in defining the semantics for state blocks. Applications and the runtime had to do extra work and be careful while recording and playing back state blocks.In Direct3D 9, use SetSoftwareVertexProcessing instead. This new API is not recorded by StateBlocks.

            This method draws indexed primitives from the current set of data input streams. MinIndex  and all the indices in the index stream are relative to the BaseVertexIndex.The MinIndex  and NumVertices  parameters specify the range of vertex indices used for each <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.DrawIndexedPrimitive(SharpDX.Direct3D9.PrimitiveType,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32)"/> call. These are used to optimize vertex processing of indexed primitives by processing a sequential range of vertices prior to indexing into these vertices. It is invalid for any indices used during this call to reference any vertices outside of this range.IDirect3DDevice9::DrawIndexedPrimitive fails if no index array is set.The <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PrimitiveType.PointList"/> member of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PrimitiveType"/> enumerated type is not supported and is not a valid type for this method.When converting a legacy application to Direct3D 9, you must add a call to either <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.SetVertexFormat(SharpDX.Direct3D9.VertexFormat)"/> to use the fixed function pipeline, or <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.SetVertexDeclaration(SharpDX.Direct3D9.VertexDeclaration)"/> to use a vertex shader before you make any Draw calls.

            <remarks>	
            The order of operations for this method is as follows:Transform vertices to projection space using the world + view + projection matrix. Compute screen coordinates using viewport settings. If clipping is enabled, compute clipping codes and store them in an internal buffer, associated with the destination vertex buffer. If a vertex is inside the viewing frustum, its screen coordinates are computed. If the vertex is outside the viewing frustum, the vertex is stored in the destination vertex buffer in projection space coordinates. Other notes: The user does not have access to the internal clip code buffer. No clipping is done on triangles or any other primitives.The destination vertex buffer, pDestBuffer, must be created with a nonzero FVF parameter in <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.CreateVertexBuffer(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Usage,SharpDX.Direct3D9.VertexFormat,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool,SharpDX.Direct3D9.VertexBuffer,System.IntPtr)"/>. The FVF code specified during the call to the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.CreateVertexBuffer(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Usage,SharpDX.Direct3D9.VertexFormat,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool,SharpDX.Direct3D9.VertexBuffer,System.IntPtr)"/> method specifies the vertex elements present in the destination vertex buffer.When Direct3D generates texture coordinates, or copies or transforms input texture coordinates, and the output texture coordinate format defines more texture coordinate components than Direct3D generates, Direct3D does not change these extra components.

            <remarks>	
            When a FVF vertex shader is used, the stride of the vertex stream must match the vertex size, computed from the FVF. When a declaration is used, the stride should be greater than or equal to the stream size computed from the declaration.When calling SetStreamSource, the stride is normally required to be equal to the vertex size. However, there are times when you may want to draw multiple instances of the same or similar geometry (such as when using instancing to draw). For this case, use a zero stride to tell the runtime not to increment the vertex buffer offset (ie: use the same vertex data for all instances). For more information about instancing, see Efficiently Drawing Multiple Instances of Geometry (Direct3D 9).

            A stream is defined as a uniform array of component data, where each component consists of one or more elements representing a single entity such as position, normal, color, and so on.When a FVF vertex shader is used, the stride of the vertex stream must match the vertex size, computed from the FVF. When a declaration is used, the stride should be greater than or equal to the stream size computed from the declaration.Calling this method will increase the internal reference count on the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.VertexBuffer"/> interface. Failure to call IUnknown::Release when finished using this <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.VertexBuffer"/> interface results in a memory leak.

When rendering a cached patch, you must set the same vertex shader that was set when it was captured.Calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.DrawRectanglePatch(System.Int32,System.Single[])"/> with a handle invalidates the same handle cached by a previous <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.DrawTrianglePatch(System.Int32,System.Single[])"/> call.For dynamic patches, the patch data changes for every rendering of the patch, so it is not efficient to cache information.

            <remarks>	
            The GDI dialog boxes must be created as child to the device window. They should also be created within the same thread that created the device because this enables the parent window to manage redrawing the child window.The method has no effect for windowed mode applications, but this setting will be respected if the application resets the device into full-screen mode. If SetDialogBoxMode succeeds in a windowed mode application, any subsequent reset to full-screen mode will be checked against the restrictions listed above.  Also, SetDialogBoxMode causes all back buffers on the swap chain to be discarded, so an application is expected to refresh its content for all back buffers after this call.

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            When clipping is enabled during vertex processing (by <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.ProcessVertices(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.VertexBuffer,SharpDX.Direct3D9.VertexDeclaration,SharpDX.Direct3D9.LockFlags)"/>, <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.DrawPrimitives(SharpDX.Direct3D9.PrimitiveType,System.Int32,System.Int32)"/>, or other drawing functions), Direct3D computes a clip code for every vertex. The clip code is a combination of D3DCS_* bits. When a vertex is outside a particular clipping plane, the corresponding bit is set in the clipping code. Direct3D maintains the clip status using <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ClipStatus"/>, which has ClipUnion and ClipIntersection members. ClipUnion is a bitwise "OR" of all vertex clip codes and ClipIntersection is a bitwise "AND" of all vertex clip codes. Initial values are zero for ClipUnion and 0xFFFFFFFF for ClipIntersection. When <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.RenderState.Clipping"/> is set to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/>, ClipUnion and ClipIntersection are set to zero. Direct3D updates the clip status during drawing calls. To compute clip status for a particular object, set ClipUnion and ClipIntersection to their initial value and continue drawing.Clip status is not updated by <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.DrawRectanglePatch(System.Int32,System.Single[])"/> and <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.DrawTrianglePatch(System.Int32,System.Single[])"/> because there is no software emulation for them.Clip status is used during software vertex processing. Therefore, this method is not supported on pure or nonpure hardware processing devices. For more information about pure devices, see <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.CreateFlags"/>.

            <remarks>	
            An application can create a mixed-mode device to use both the software vertex processing and the hardware vertex processing. To switch between the two vertex processing modes in DirectX 8.x, use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.SetRenderState(SharpDX.Direct3D9.RenderState,System.Boolean)"/> with the render state D3DRS_SOFTWAREVERTEXPROCESSING and the appropriate <see cref="T:System.Boolean"/> argument. The drawback of the render state approach was the difficulty in defining the semantics for state blocks. Applications and the runtime had to do extra work and be careful while recording and playing back state blocks.In Direct3D 9, use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.SetSoftwareVertexProcessing(System.Boolean)"/> instead. This new API is not recorded by StateBlocks.

            <remarks>	
            Textures created with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool.Default"/> are not lockable. Textures created in video memory are lockable when created with USAGE_DYNAMIC.For performance reasons, dirty regions are recorded only for level zero of a texture. Dirty regions are automatically recorded when <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Texture.LockRectangle(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.LockFlags)"/> is called without <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.LockFlags.NoDirtyUpdate"/> or <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.LockFlags.ReadOnly"/>. See <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.UpdateTexture(SharpDX.Direct3D9.BaseTexture,SharpDX.Direct3D9.BaseTexture)"/> for more information.The only lockable format for a depth-stencil texture is D3DLOCK_D16_LOCKABLE.Video memory textures cannot be locked, but must be modified by calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.UpdateSurface(SharpDX.Direct3D9.Surface,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Surface)"/> or <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.UpdateTexture(SharpDX.Direct3D9.BaseTexture,SharpDX.Direct3D9.BaseTexture)"/>. There are exceptions for some proprietary driver pixel formats that Direct3D 9 does not recognize. These can be locked.This method cannot retrieve data from a texture resource created with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Usage.RenderTarget"/> because such a texture must be assigned to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool.Default"/> memory and is therefore not lockable. In this case, use instead <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.GetRenderTargetData(SharpDX.Direct3D9.Surface,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Surface)"/> to copy texture data from device memory to system memory.

            <remarks>	
            For performance reasons, dirty regions are only recorded for level zero of a texture. For sublevels, it is assumed that the corresponding (scaled) rectangle or box is also dirty. Dirty regions are automatically recorded when <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Texture.LockRectangle(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.LockFlags)"/> is called without <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.LockFlags.NoDirtyUpdate"/> or <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.LockFlags.ReadOnly"/>. The destination surface of <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.UpdateSurface(SharpDX.Direct3D9.Surface,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Surface)"/> is also marked dirty automatically.Using <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.LockFlags.NoDirtyUpdate"/> and explicitly specifying dirty regions can be used to increase the efficiency of <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.UpdateTexture(SharpDX.Direct3D9.BaseTexture,SharpDX.Direct3D9.BaseTexture)"/>. Using this method, applications can optimize what subset of a resource is copied by specifying dirty regions on the resource. However, the dirty regions may be expanded to optimize alignment.

See <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format"/>.For performance reasons, dirty regions are recorded only for level zero of a texture.

In this case, use instead <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.GetRenderTargetData(SharpDX.Direct3D9.Surface,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Surface)"/> to copy texture data from device memory to system memory.

            <remarks>
            This method returns a fully working device interface, set to the required display mode (or windowed), and allocated with the appropriate back buffers. To begin rendering, the application needs only to create and set a depth buffer (assuming EnableAutoDepthStencil is FALSE in <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters"/>). When you create a Direct3D device, you supply two different window parameters: a focus window (hFocusWindow) and a device window (the hDeviceWindow in <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters"/>). The purpose of each window is:  The focus window alerts Direct3D when an application switches from foreground mode to background mode (via Alt-Tab, a mouse click, or some other method). A single focus window is shared by each device created by an application. The device window determines the location and size of the back buffer on screen. This is used by Direct3D when the back buffer contents are copied to the front buffer during {{Present}}.  This method should not be run during the handling of WM_CREATE. An application should never pass a window handle to Direct3D while handling WM_CREATE.  Any call to create, release, or reset the device must be done using the same thread as the window procedure of the focus window. Note that D3DCREATE_HARDWARE_VERTEXPROCESSING, D3DCREATE_MIXED_VERTEXPROCESSING, and D3DCREATE_SOFTWARE_VERTEXPROCESSING are mutually exclusive flags, and at least one of these vertex processing flags must be specified when calling this method. Back buffers created as part of the device are only lockable if D3DPRESENTFLAG_LOCKABLE_BACKBUFFER is specified in the presentation parameters. (Multisampled back buffers and depth surfaces are never lockable.) The methods {{Reset}}, <see cref="T:SharpDX.ComObject"/>, and {{TestCooperativeLevel}} must be called from the same thread that used this method to create a device. D3DFMT_UNKNOWN can be specified for the windowed mode back buffer format when calling CreateDevice, {{Reset}}, and {{CreateAdditionalSwapChain}}. This means the application does not have to query the current desktop format before calling CreateDevice for windowed mode. For full-screen mode, the back buffer format must be specified. If you attempt to create a device on a 0x0 sized window, CreateDevice will fail.

            <remarks>	
            This method is designed to filter a single color texture. A monochrome convolution filter is a 2D box filter with all of the weights set to 1.0;  the filter kernel resolution ranges from 1 x 1 to 7 x 7. When monochrome texture filtering is set to a texture sampler and texture sampling is performed at location, then Direct3D performs convolution.Restrictions include:The filter specified by this method is recorded in state blocks as a part of <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.StateBlockType.PixelState"/>. The only texture address mode supported is: <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.TextureAddressCaps.Border"/>; the border color is always 0. This method is not supported for mipmaps. Using a non-monochrome texture with convolution filtering will generate a driver error.

            Glyphs from a one-bit source surface are put together into another one-bit texture surface with this method. The destination surface can then be used as the source for a normal texturing operation that will filter and scale the strings of text onto some other non-monochrome surface.This method has several constraints (which are similar to StretchRect):Surfaces cannot be locked. The source and destination surfaces cannot be the same surface. The source and destination surfaces must be created with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format.A1"/> format. The source surface and both vertex buffers must be created with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool.Default"/> flag. The destination surface must be created with either the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool.Default"/> or <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool.SystemMemory"/> flags. The source rectangles must be within the source surface.The method is not recorded in state blocks.

            This API is no more than a reasonable guess at residency, since resources may have been demoted by the time the application uses them.The expected usage pattern is as follows. If the application determines that a set of resources are not resident, then the application will substitute a lower-LOD version of the resource and continue with rendering. The video memory manager API, offers a feature to allow the application to express that it would like these lower-LOD resources to be made more likely to stay resident in GPU-accessible memory. It is the app's responsibility to create, fill and destroy these lower-LOD versions, if it so chooses.The application also needs to begin promotion of the higher-LOD versions when the residency check indicates that the resource is not resident in GPU-accessible memory. Since a per-process lock exists in kernel mode, a performant implementation will spawn a separate process whose sole job is to promote resources. The application communicates resource identity between the two process by means of the Sharing Resources shared surfaces API and promotes them by means of the SetPriority.

            Frame latency is the number of frames that are allowed to be stored in a queue, before submission for rendering. Latency is often used to control how the CPU chooses between responding to user input and frames that are in the render queue.It is often beneficial for applications that have no user input (for example, video playback) to queue more than 3 frames of data.

            <remarks>	
            Frame latency is the number of frames that are allowed to be stored in a queue, before submission for rendering. Latency is often used to control how the CPU chooses between responding to user input and frames that are in the render queue.It is often beneficial for applications that have no user input (for example, video playback) to queue more than 3 frames of data.

They do not need to be re-created explicitly by the application.There are two different types of swap chains: full-screen or windowed. If the new swap chain is full-screen, the adapter will be placed in the display mode that matches the new size.Applications can expect messages to be sent to them during this call (for example, before this call is returned); applications should take precautions not to call into Direct3D at this time.A call to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.DeviceEx.ResetEx(SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters@)"/> will fail if called on a different thread than that used to create the device being reset.D3DFMT_UNKNOWN can be specified for the windowed mode back buffer format when calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Direct3DEx.CreateDeviceEx(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.DeviceType,System.IntPtr,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters[],SharpDX.Direct3D9.DisplayModeEx[],SharpDX.Direct3D9.DeviceEx)"/>, <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.DeviceEx.ResetEx(SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters@)"/>, and <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.CreateAdditionalSwapChain(SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters@,SharpDX.Direct3D9.SwapChain)"/>. This means the application does not have to query the current desktop format before calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Direct3DEx.CreateDeviceEx(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.DeviceType,System.IntPtr,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters[],SharpDX.Direct3D9.DisplayModeEx[],SharpDX.Direct3D9.DeviceEx)"/> for windowed mode. For full-screen mode, the back buffer format must be specified. Setting BackBufferCount equal to zero (BackBufferCount = 0) results in one back buffer.When trying to reset more than one display adapter in a group, set pPresentationParameters to point to an array of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters"/> structures, one for each display in the adapter group.If a multihead device was created with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.CreateFlags.AdapterGroupDevice"/>, <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.DeviceEx.ResetEx(SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters@)"/> requires an array of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters"/> structures wherein each structure must specify a full-screen display. To switch back to windowed mode, the application must destroy the device and re-create a non-multihead device in windowed mode.

            <remarks>	
            The compiler setting also determines the function version. If Unicode is defined, the function call resolves to PreloadTextW. Otherwise, the function call resolves to PreloadTextA because ANSI strings are being used. This method generates textures that contain glyphs that represent the input text. The glyphs are drawn as a series of triangles. Text will not be rendered to the device; ID3DX10Font::DrawText must still be called to render the text. However, by preloading text into video memory, ID3DX10Font::DrawText will use substantially fewer CPU resources. This method internally converts characters to glyphs using the GDI function {{GetCharacterPlacement}}.

            <remarks>
            The parameters of this method are very similar to those of the GDI DrawText function.This method supports both ANSI and Unicode strings.This method must be called inside a  BeginScene ... EndScene block. The only exception is when an application calls DrawText with DT_CALCRECT to calculate the size of a given block of text.Unless the DT_NOCLIP format is used, this method clips the text so that it does not appear outside the specified rectangle. All formatting is assumed to have multiple lines unless the DT_SINGLELINE format is specified.If the selected font is too large for the rectangle, this method does not attempt to substitute a smaller font.This method supports only fonts whose escapement and orientation are both zero.

            <returns>If the method succeeds, the return value is <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ResultCode.Success"/>. If the method fails because capture cannot be done while in record mode, the return value is <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ResultCode.InvalidCall"/>.</returns>	
            <remarks>	
            The Capture method captures current values for states within an existing state block. It does not capture the entire state of the device. For example:<code>	
             <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.StateBlock"/>* pStateBlock = <c>null</c>; pd3dDevice-&gt;BeginStateBlock();	
            // Add the ZENABLE state to the stateblock 	
            pd3dDevice-&gt;SetRenderState ( <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.RenderState.ZEnable"/>, <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ZBufferType.UseZBuffer"/> );	
            pd3dDevice-&gt;EndStateBlock ( &amp;pStateBlock ); // Change the current value that is stored in the state block	
            pd3dDevice-&gt;SetRenderState ( <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.RenderState.ZEnable"/>, <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ZBufferType.DontUseZBuffer"/> );	
            pStateBlock-&gt;Capture();			 pStateBlock-&gt;Release();	
            	
            </code>Creating an empty stateblock and calling the Capture method does nothing if no states have been set.The Capture method  will not capture information for lights that are explicitly or implicitly created after the stateblock is created.

            As a general rule, do not hold a lock across more than one frame. When working with index buffers, you are allowed to make multiple lock calls.

            <remarks>	
            For performance reasons, dirty regions are only recorded for level zero of a texture. For sublevels, it is assumed that the corresponding (scaled) rectangle or box is also dirty. Dirty regions are automatically recorded when <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.CubeTexture.LockRectangle(SharpDX.Direct3D9.CubeMapFace,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.LockFlags)"/> is called without <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.LockFlags.NoDirtyUpdate"/> or <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.LockFlags.ReadOnly"/>. The destination surface of <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.UpdateSurface(SharpDX.Direct3D9.Surface,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Surface)"/> is also marked dirty automatically.Using <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.LockFlags.NoDirtyUpdate"/> and explicitly specifying dirty regions can be used to increase the efficiency of <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.UpdateTexture(SharpDX.Direct3D9.BaseTexture,SharpDX.Direct3D9.BaseTexture)"/>. Using this method, applications can optimize what subset of a resource is copied by specifying dirty regions on the resource. However, the dirty regions may be expanded to optimize alignment.

            Writing to a non-level-zero surface of the volume texture will not cause the dirty rectangle to be updated.

            <returns>The return type identifies the query state (see Queries (Direct3D 9)). The method returns <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.Ok"/> if the query data is available and S_FALSE if it is not.  These are considered successful return values. If the method fails when D3DGETDATA_FLUSH is used, the return value can be <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ResultCode.DeviceLost"/>.</returns>	
            <remarks>	
            It is possible to lose the device while polling for query status. When D3DGETDATA_FLUSH is specified, this method will return <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ResultCode.DeviceLost"/> in response to a lost device. This allows an application to prevent threads from endlessly polling due to a lost device (which cannot respond to the query).An application must never write code that only invokes GetData ( ... , 0 ), expecting that GetData will eventually return <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.Ok"/> by itself over time. This is true, even if the application has used the FLUSH flag with GetData in the past. For example:<code>	
            // Enables an infinite loop:	
            while( pQuery-&gt;GetData( ... , 0 ) == S_FALSE ) ; // Still enables an infinite loop:	
            pQuery-&gt;GetData( ... , D3DGETDATA_FLUSH );	
            while( pQuery-&gt;GetData( ... , 0 ) == S_FALSE ) ; // Does not enable an infinite loop because eventually the command	
            // buffer will fill up and that will cause a flush to occur.	
            while( pQuery-&gt;GetData( ..., 0 ) == S_FALSE ) { pDevice-&gt;SetTexture(...); pDevice-&gt;Draw(...);	
            }	
            	
            </code>

Valid values are 0, or any combination of <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Present.DoNotWait"/> or <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Present.LinearContent"/>. </para>  If dwFlags = 0, this method behaves as it did prior to Direct3D 9. Present will spin until the hardware is free, without returning an error. If dwFlags = <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Present.DoNotWait"/>, and the hardware is busy processing or waiting for a vertical sync interval, the method will return <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ResultCode.WasStillDrawing"/>. If dwFlags = <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Present.LinearContent"/>, gamma correction is performed from linear space to sRGB for windowed swap chains. This flag will take effect only when the driver exposes <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Caps3.LinearToSrgbPresentation"/> (see Gamma (Direct3D 9)). Appliations should specify this flag if the backbuffer format is 16-bit floating point in order to match windowed mode present to fullscreen gamma behavior.</param>	
            <returns>If the method succeeds, the return value is <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ResultCode.Success"/>. If the method fails, the return value can be one of the following: <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ResultCode.DeviceLost"/>, <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ResultCode.DriverInternalError"/>, <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ResultCode.InvalidCall"/>, <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ResultCode.OutOfVideoMemory"/>, E_OUTOFMEMORY.</returns>	
            <remarks>	
            The Present method is a shortcut to Present. Present has been updated to take a flag allowing the application to request that the method return immediately when the driver reports that it cannot schedule a presentation.If necessary, a stretch operation is applied to transfer the pixels within the source rectangle to the destination rectangle in the client area of the target window.Present will fail if called between BeginScene and EndScene pairs unless the render target is not the current render target (such as the back buffer you get from creating an additional swap chain). This is a new behavior for Direct3D 9.

If the user dynamically adds adapters (either by adding devices to the desktop, or by hot-docking a laptop), these devices are not included in the enumeration. Creating a new <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Direct3DEx"/> interface will expose the new devices.Pass the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.D3D9.SdkVersion"/> flag to this function to ensure that header files used in the compiled application match the version of the installed runtime DLLs. <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.D3D9.SdkVersion"/> is changed in the runtime only when a header or another code change would require rebuilding the application. If this function fails, it indicates that the versions of the header file and the runtime DLL do not match.Note??Direct3DCreate9Ex is supported only in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and Windows 7.

            The Direct3D object is the first Direct3D COM object that your graphical application needs to create and the last object that your application needs to release. Functions for enumerating and retrieving capabilities of a device are accessible through the Direct3D object.

            </code>The <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Direct3D"/> interface supports enumeration of active display adapters and allows the creation of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device"/> objects. If the user dynamically adds adapters (either by adding devices to the desktop, or by hot-docking a laptop), those devices will not be included in the enumeration. Creating a new <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Direct3D"/> interface will expose the new devices.D3D_SDK_VERSION is passed to this function to ensure that the header files against which an application is compiled match the version of the runtime DLL's that are installed on the machine. <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.D3D9.SdkVersion"/> is only changed in the runtime when a header change (or other code change) would require an application to be rebuilt. If this function fails, it indicates that the header file version does not match the runtime DLL version.For an example, see Creating a Device (Direct3D 9).

            The compiler setting also determines the function version. If Unicode is defined, the function call resolves to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.D3DX9.LoadMeshHierarchyFromXW(System.String,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device,SharpDX.Direct3D9.IAllocateHierarchy,SharpDX.Direct3D9.ILoadUserData,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Frame@,SharpDX.Direct3D9.AnimationController@)"/>. Otherwise, the function call resolves to D3DXLoadMeshHierarchyFromXA.All the meshes in the file will be collapsed into one output mesh. If the file contains a frame hierarchy, all the transformations will be applied to the mesh.D3DXLoadMeshHierarchyFromX loads the animation data and frame hierarchy from a .x file. It scans the .x file and builds a frame hierarchy and animation controller according to the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.IAllocateHierarchy"/>-derived object passed to it through pAlloc. Loading the data requires several steps as follows:Derive <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.IAllocateHierarchy"/>, implementing each method.  This controls how frames and meshes are allocated and freed. Derive <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ILoadUserData"/>, implementing each method. If your .x file has no embedded user-defined data, or if you do not need it, you can skip this part. Create an object of your <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.IAllocateHierarchy"/> class, and optionally of your LoadUserData class. You do not need to call any methods of these objects yourself. Call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.D3DX9.LoadMeshHierarchyFromXW(System.String,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device,SharpDX.Direct3D9.IAllocateHierarchy,SharpDX.Direct3D9.ILoadUserData,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Frame@,SharpDX.Direct3D9.AnimationController@)"/>, passing in your <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.IAllocateHierarchy"/> object and your <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ILoadUserData"/> object (or <c>null</c>) to create the frame hierarchy and animation controller.  All the animation sets and frames are automatically registered to the animation controller.During the load, CreateFrame and LoadFrameChildData are called back on each frame to control loading and allocation of the frame.  The application defines these methods to control how frames are stored.  CreateMeshContainer and LoadMeshChildData are called back on each mesh object to control loading and allocation of mesh objects.  LoadTopLevelData is called back for each top level object that doesn't get loaded by the other methods.To free this data, call ID3DXAnimationController::Release to free the animation sets, and D3DXFRAMEDestroy, passing in the root node of the frame hierarchy and an object of your derived <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.IAllocateHierarchy"/> class.  DestroyFrame and DestroyMeshContainer will each be called for every frame and mesh object in the frame hierarchy.  Your implementation of DestroyFrame should release everything allocated by CreateFrame, and likewise for the mesh container methods.

            <remarks>	
            The <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.D3DX9.IntersectSubset(SharpDX.Direct3D9.BaseMesh,System.Int32,SharpDX.Vector3,SharpDX.Vector3,System.Boolean,System.Int32,System.Single,System.Single,System.Single,SharpDX.Direct3D.Blob@,System.Int32)"/> function provides a way to understand points in and around a triangle, independent of where the triangle is actually located. This function returns the resulting point by using the following equation: V1 + U(V2 - V1) + V(V3 - V1).Any point in the plane V1V2V3 can be represented by the barycentric coordinate (U,V). The parameter U controls how much V2 gets weighted into the result and the parameter V controls how much V3 gets weighted into the result. Lastly, the value of [1 - (U + V)] controls how much V1 gets weighted into the result.Barycentric coordinates are a form of general coordinates. In this context, using barycentric coordinates represents a change in coordinate systems. What holds true for Cartesian coordinates holds true for barycentric coordinates.Barycentric coordinates define a point inside a triangle in terms of the triangle's vertices.  For a more in-depth description of barycentric coordinates, see Mathworld's Barycentric Coordinates Description.

            Given a texture that maps over the surface of the mesh, the algorithm computes the IMT for each face. This will cause triangles containing lower-frequency signal data to take up less space in the final texture atlas when parameterized with the UVAtlas functions. The texture is assumed to be interpolated over the mesh bilinearly.

            <remarks>	
            The compiler setting also determines the function version. If Unicode is defined, the function call resolves to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.D3DX9.SaveMeshToXW(System.String,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Mesh,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.ExtendedMaterial@,SharpDX.Direct3D9.EffectInstance,System.Int32,System.Int32)"/>. Otherwise, the function call resolves to D3DXSaveMeshToXA because ANSI strings are being used.The default file format is binary; however, if a file is specified as both a binary and a text file, it will be saved as a text file. Regardless of the file format, you may also use the compressed format to reduce the file size.The following is a typical code example of how to use this function.<code>	
             <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Mesh"/>*    m_pMesh;           // Mesh object to be saved to a .x file	
            <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ExtendedMaterial"/>* m_pMaterials;      // Array of material structs in the mesh

            The <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.D3DX9.Intersect(SharpDX.Direct3D9.BaseMesh,SharpDX.Vector3,SharpDX.Vector3,System.Boolean,System.Int32,System.Single,System.Single,System.Single,SharpDX.Direct3D.Blob@,System.Int32)"/> function provides a way to understand points in and around a triangle, independent of where the triangle is actually located. This function returns the resulting point by using the following equation: V1 + U(V2 - V1) + V(V3 - V1).Any point in the plane V1V2V3 can be represented by the barycentric coordinate (U,V). The parameter U controls how much V2 gets weighted into the result, and the parameter V controls how much V3 gets weighted into the result. Lastly, the value of [1 - (U + V)] controls how much V1 gets weighted into the result.Barycentric coordinates are a form of general coordinates. In this context, using barycentric coordinates represents a change in coordinate systems. What holds true for Cartesian coordinates holds true for barycentric coordinates.Barycentric coordinates define a point inside a triangle in terms of the triangle's vertices.  For a more in-depth description of barycentric coordinates, see Mathworld's Barycentric Coordinates Description.

            For mesh files that do not contain effect instance information, default effect instances will be generated from the material information in the .x file. A default effect instance will have default values that correspond to the members of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Material"/> structure.The default texture name is also filled in, but is handled differently. The name will be Texture0@Name, which corresponds to an effect variable by the name of "Texture0" with an annotation called "Name." This will contain the string file name for the texture.

            The <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.D3DX9.Intersect(SharpDX.Direct3D9.BaseMesh,SharpDX.Vector3,SharpDX.Vector3,System.Boolean,System.Int32,System.Single,System.Single,System.Single,SharpDX.Direct3D.Blob@,System.Int32)"/> function provides a way to understand points in and around a triangle, independent of where the triangle is actually located. This function returns the resulting point by using the following equation: V1 + U(V2 - V1) + V(V3 - V1).Any point in the plane V1V2V3 can be represented by the barycentric coordinate (U,V). The parameter U controls how much V2 gets weighted into the result, and the parameter V controls how much V3 gets weighted into the result. Lastly, the value of [1 - (U + V)] controls how much V1 gets weighted into the result.Barycentric coordinates are a form of general coordinates. In this context, using barycentric coordinates represents a change in coordinate systems. What holds true for Cartesian coordinates holds true for barycentric coordinates.Barycentric coordinates define a point inside a triangle in terms of the triangle's vertices.  For a more in-depth description of barycentric coordinates, see Mathworld's Barycentric Coordinates Description.

This is the way to find out what the input vertex format is for a high-level shader language (HLSL) shader. If the shader has additional inputs that your vertex declaration is missing, you could create an extra vertex stream that has a stride of 0 that has the missing components with default values. For instance, this technique could be used to provide default vertex color for models that do not specify it.

To call SetRenderTarget with a cube texture, you must select an individual face using GetCubeMapSurface and pass the resulting surface to SetRenderTarget.D3DXCreateCubeTextureFromFileEx uses the DirectDraw surface (DDS) file format. The DirectX Texture Editor (Dxtex.exe) enables you to generate a cube map from other file formats and save it in the DDS file format.When skipping mipmap levels while loading a .dds file, use the D3DX_SKIP_DDS_MIP_LEVELS macro to generate the MipFilter value. This macro takes the number of levels to skip and the filter type and returns the filter value, which would then be passed into the MipFilter parameter.

If this happens, the images need to be loaded manually.Note that a resource created with this function will be placed in the memory class denoted by <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool.Managed"/>.Filtering is automatically applied to a texture created using this method. The filtering is equivalent to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Filter.Triangle"/> | <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Filter.Dither"/> in <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Filter"/>.For the best performance when using D3DXCreateTextureFromFile:Doing image scaling and format conversion at load time can be slow. Store images in the format and resolution they will be used. If the target hardware requires power of two dimensions, create and store images using power of two dimensions. Consider using DirectDraw surface (DDS) files. Because DDS files can be used to represent any Direct3D 9 texture format, they are very easy for D3DX to read. Also, they can store mipmaps, so any mipmap-generation algorithms can be used to author the images.

            <remarks>	
            The compiler setting also determines the function version. If Unicode is defined, the function call resolves to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.D3DX9.CreateVolumeTextureFromFileExW(SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device,System.String,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Color4,System.IntPtr,SharpDX.Direct3D9.PaletteEntry[],SharpDX.Direct3D9.VolumeTexture@)"/>. Otherwise, the function call resolves to D3DXCreateVolumeTextureFromFileExA because ANSI strings are being used.This function supports the following file formats: .bmp, .dds, .dib, .hdr, .jpg, .pfm, .png, .ppm, and .tga. See <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ImageFileFormat"/>.Mipmapped textures automatically have each level filled with the loaded volume texture. When loading images into mipmapped textures, some devices are unable to go to a 1x1 image and this function will fail. If this happens, then the images need to be loaded manually.When skipping mipmap levels while loading a .dds file, use the D3DX_SKIP_DDS_MIP_LEVELS macro to generate the MipFilter value. This macro takes the number of levels to skip and the filter type and returns the filter value, which would then be passed into the MipFilter parameter.

If Unicode is defined, the function call resolves to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.D3DX9.CreateTextureFromResourceExW(SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device,System.IntPtr,System.String,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Color4,SharpDX.Direct3D9.ImageInformation@,SharpDX.Direct3D9.PaletteEntry,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Texture@)"/>. Otherwise, the function call resolves to D3DXCreateTextureFromResourceExA because ANSI strings are being used.The resource being loaded must be of type RT_BITMAP or RT_RCDATA. Resource type RT_RCDATA is used to load formats other than bitmaps (such as .tga, .jpg, and .dds).This function supports the following file formats: .bmp, .dds, .dib, .hdr, .jpg, .pfm, .png, .ppm, and .tga.

            <remarks>	
            The compiler setting also determines the function version. If Unicode is defined, the function call resolves to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.D3DX9.CreateTextureFromFileExW(SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device,System.String,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Color4,System.IntPtr,SharpDX.Direct3D9.PaletteEntry[],SharpDX.Direct3D9.Texture@)"/>. Otherwise, the function call resolves to D3DXCreateTextureFromFileExA because ANSI strings are being used.Use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.D3DX9.CheckTextureRequirements(SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device,System.Int32@,System.Int32@,System.Int32@,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format@,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool)"/> to determine if your device can support the texture given the current state.This function supports the following file formats: .bmp, .dds, .dib, .hdr, .jpg, .pfm, .png, .ppm, and .tga. See <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D9.ImageFileFormat"/>.Mipmapped textures automatically have each level filled with the loaded texture. When loading images into mipmapped textures, some devices are unable to go to a 1x1 image and this function will fail. If this happens, then the images need to be loaded manually.For the best performance when using D3DXCreateTextureFromFileEx:Doing image scaling and format conversion at load time can be slow. Store images in the format and resolution they will be used. If the target hardware requires power of 2 dimensions, then create and store images using power of 2 dimensions. For mipmap image creation at load time, filter using <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Filter.Box"/>. A box filter is much faster than other filter types such as <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Filter.Triangle"/>. Consider using DDS files. Since DDS files can be used to represent any Direct3D 9 texture format, they are very easy for D3DX to read. Also, they can store mipmaps, so any mipmap-generation algorithms can be used to author the images.When skipping mipmap levels while loading a .dds file, use the D3DX_SKIP_DDS_MIP_LEVELS macro to generate the MipFilter value. This macro takes the number of levels to skip and the filter type and returns the filter value, which would then be passed into the MipFilter parameter.

            After an application generates adjacency information for a mesh, the mesh data can be optimized (reordered) for better drawing performance. This method determines which patches are adjacent (within the provided tolerance).Adjacency information is also used to optimize tessellation. Generate adjacency information once and tessellate repeatedly by calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.PatchMesh.Tessellate(System.Single,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Mesh)"/>. The optimization performed is independent of the actual tessellation level used. However, if the mesh vertices are changed, you must regenerate the adjacency information.

            This method should be called whenever the device is lost or before the user calls <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.Reset(SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters[])"/>. Even if the device was not actually lost, <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.RenderToSurface.OnLostDevice"/> is responsible for freeing stateblocks and other resources that may need to be released before resetting the device. As a result, the font object cannot be used again before calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Device.Reset(SharpDX.Direct3D9.PresentParameters[])"/> and then <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D9.RenderToSurface.OnResetDevice"/>.

You can make multiple lock calls. However, you must ensure that the number of lock calls matches the number of unlock calls.Because file data is not guaranteed to be aligned properly with byte boundaries, you should access ppData with UNALIGNED references.Returned parameter values are not guaranteed to be valid due to possible file corruption; therefore, your code should verify the returned parameter values.
