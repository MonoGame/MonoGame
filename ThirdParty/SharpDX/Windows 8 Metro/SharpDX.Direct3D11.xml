The default friendly name is "&lt;unnamed&gt;". You can set the friendly name so that you can determine if the corresponding object interface reference caused the leak. To set the friendly name, use the SetPrivateData method and the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.CommonGuid.DebugObjectName"/> <see cref="T:System.Guid"/> that is in D3Dcommon.h. For example, to give pContext a friendly name of My name, use the following code:<code>

            hr = pContext-&gt;SetPrivateData( <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.CommonGuid.DebugObjectName"/>, sizeof( c_szName ) - 1, c_szName );

            <remarks>	
            Resource priorities determine which resource to evict from video memory when the system has run out of video memory. The resource will not be lost; it will be removed from video memory and placed into system memory, or possibly placed onto the hard drive. The resource will be loaded back into video memory when it is required.A resource that is set to the maximum priority, <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.ResourcePriority.Maximum"/>, is only evicted if there is no other way of resolving the incoming memory request. The Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) tries to split an incoming memory request to its minimum size and evict lower-priority resources before evicting a resource with maximum priority.Changing the priorities of resources should be done carefully. The wrong eviction priorities could be a detriment to performance rather than an improvement.

            For more information about using the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ClassInstance"/> interface, see Dynamic Linking.An instance is not restricted to being used for a single type in a single shader. An instance is flexible and can be used for any shader that used the same type name or instance name when the instance was generated.A created instance will work for any shader that contains a type of the same type name. For instance, a class instance created with the type name DefaultShader would work in any shader that contained a type DefaultShader even though several shaders could describe a different type. A gotten instance maps directly to an instance name/index in a shader.  A class instance aquired using GetClassInstance will work for any shader that contains a class instance of the name used to generate the runtime instance, the instance does not have to be the same type in all of the shaders it's used in.An instance does not replace the importance of reflection for a particular shader since a gotten instance will not know its slot location and a created instance only specifies a type name.

            This method returns a reference to the resource we are gaining access to.
            </returns>
            <remarks>
            To share a resource between two Direct3D 10 devices the resource must have been created with the  <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.Shared"/> flag, if it was created using the ID3D10Device interface.  If it was created using the IDXGIDevice interface, then the resource is always shared. The REFIID, or GUID, of the interface to the resource can be obtained by using the __uuidof() macro.  For example, __uuidof(ID3D10Buffer) will get the GUID of the interface to a buffer resource. When sharing a resource between two Direct3D 10 devices the unique handle of the resource can be obtained by querying the resource for the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Resource"/> interface and then calling {{GetSharedHandle}}.
            <code> IDXGIResource* pOtherResource(NULL);
            hr = pOtherDeviceResource-&gt;QueryInterface( __uuidof(IDXGIResource), (void**)&amp;pOtherResource );
            HANDLE sharedHandle;
            pOtherResource-&gt;GetSharedHandle(&amp;sharedHandle); </code>
            The only resources that can be shared are 2D non-mipmapped textures. To share a resource between a Direct3D 9 device and a Direct3D 10 device the texture must have been created using  the pSharedHandle argument of {{CreateTexture}}.   The shared Direct3D 9 handle is then passed to OpenSharedResource in the hResource argument. The following code illustrates the method calls involved.
            <code> sharedHandle = NULL; // must be set to NULL to create, can use a valid handle here to open in D3D9
            pDevice9-&gt;CreateTexture(..., pTex2D_9, &amp;sharedHandle);
            ...
            pDevice10-&gt;OpenSharedResource(sharedHandle, __uuidof(ID3D10Resource), (void**)(&amp;tempResource10));
            tempResource10-&gt;QueryInterface(__uuidof(ID3D10Texture2D), (void**)(&amp;pTex2D_10));
            tempResource10-&gt;Release();
            // now use pTex2D_10 with pDevice10    </code>
            Textures being shared from D3D9 to D3D10 have the following restrictions.  Textures must be 2D Only 1 mip level is allowed Texture must have default usage Texture must be write only MSAA textures are not allowed Bind flags must have SHADER_RESOURCE and RENDER_TARGET set Only R10G10B10A2_UNORM, R16G16B16A16_FLOAT and R8G8B8A8_UNORM formats are allowed  If a shared texture is updated on one device <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.Flush"/> must be called on that device.

            <remarks>	
            For example code, see How to: Create a Vertex Buffer,  How to: Create an Index Buffer or How to: Create a Constant Buffer.The Direct3D 11.1 runtime, which is available on Windows Developer Preview and later operating systems, provides the following new functionality for CreateBuffer.You can create a constant buffer that is larger than the maximum constant buffer size that a shader can access (4096 32-bit*4-component constants ? 64KB).  When you bind the constant buffer to the pipeline (for example, via PSSetConstantBuffers or PSSetConstantBuffers1), you can define a range of the buffer that the shader can access that fits within the 4096 constant limit.The runtime will emulate this feature for feature level 9.1, 9.2, and 9.3; therefore, this feature is supported for feature level 9.1, 9.2, and 9.3.  This feature is always available on new drivers for feature level 10 and higher.  On existing drivers that are implemented to feature level 10 and higher, a call to CreateBuffer to request a constant buffer that is larger than 4096 fails.

            <remarks>	
            A resource is made up of one or more subresources; a view identifies which subresources to allow the pipeline to access. In addition, each resource is bound to the pipeline using a view. A shader-resource view is designed to bind any buffer or texture resource to the shader stages using the following  API methods: <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.VertexShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.IntPtr)"/>, <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.GeometryShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.IntPtr)"/> and <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.PixelShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.IntPtr)"/>.Because a view is fully typed, this means that typeless resources become fully typed when bound to the pipeline.Note??To successfully create a shader-resource view from a typeless buffer (for example, <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32A32_Typeless"/>), you must set the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.BufferAllowRawViews"/> flag when you create the buffer.The Direct3D 11.1 runtime, which is available starting with Windows Developer Preview, allows you to use CreateShaderResourceView for the following new purpose.You can create shader-resource views of video resources so that Direct3D shaders can process those shader-resource views. These video resources are either Texture2D or Texture2DArray. The value in the ViewDimension member of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceViewDescription"/> structure for a created shader-resource view must match the type of video resource, D3D11_SRV_DIMENSION_TEXTURE2D          for Texture2D and D3D11_SRV_DIMENSION_TEXTURE2DARRAY for Texture2DArray. Additionally, the format of the underlying video resource restricts the formats that the view can use. The video resource format values on the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Format"/> reference page specify the format values that views are restricted to.The runtime read+write conflict prevention logic (which stops a resource from being bound as an SRV and RTV or UAV at the same time) treats views of different parts of the same video surface as conflicting for simplicity.  Therefore, the runtime does not allow an application to read from luma while the application simultaneously renders to chroma in the same surface even though the hardware might allow these simultaneous operations.

            <remarks>	
            After creating an input layout object, it must be bound to the input-assembler stage before calling a draw API.Once an input-layout object is created from a shader signature, the input-layout object can be reused with any other shader that has an identical input signature (semantics included). This can simplify the creation of input-layout objects when you are working with many shaders with identical inputs.If a data type in the input-layout declaration does not match the data type in a shader-input signature, CreateInputLayout will generate a warning during compilation. The warning is simply to call attention to the fact that the data may be reinterpreted when read from a register. You may either disregard this warning (if reinterpretation is intentional) or make the data types match in both declarations to eliminate the warning.

            <remarks>	
            A deferred context is a thread-safe context that you can use to record graphics commands on a thread other than the main rendering thread.  Using a deferred context, you can record graphics commands into a command list that is encapsulated by the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.CommandList"/> interface.  After all scene items are recorded, you can then submit them to the main render thread for final rendering.  In this manner, you can perform rendering tasks concurrently across multiple threads and potentially improve performance in multi-core CPU scenarios.You can create multiple deferred contexts.Note??If you use the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceCreationFlags.SingleThreaded"/> value to create the device that is represented by <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device"/>, the CreateDeferredContext method will fail, and you will not be able to create a deferred context.For more information about deferred contexts, see Immediate and Deferred Rendering.

For example, __uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Buffer"/>) will get the <see cref="T:System.Guid"/> of the interface to a buffer resource.The unique handle of the resource is obtained differently depending on the type of device that originally created the resource.To share a resource between two Direct3D 11 devices the resource must have been created with the  <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.Shared"/> flag, if it was created using the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device"/> interface.  If it was created using a DXGI device interface, then the resource is always shared.The REFIID, or <see cref="T:System.Guid"/>, of the interface to the resource can be obtained by using the __uuidof() macro.  For example, __uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Buffer"/>) will get the <see cref="T:System.Guid"/> of the interface to a buffer resource.When sharing a resource between two Direct3D 10/11 devices the unique handle of the resource can be obtained by querying the resource for the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Resource"/> interface and then calling GetSharedHandle.<code>

            hr = pOtherDeviceResource-&gt;QueryInterface( __uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Resource"/>), (void**)&amp;pOtherResource );	
            HANDLE sharedHandle;	
            pOtherResource-&gt;GetSharedHandle(&amp;sharedHandle); 	
            </code>The only resources that can be shared are 2D non-mipmapped textures.To share a resource between a Direct3D 9 device and a Direct3D 11 device the texture must have been created using  the pSharedHandle argument of CreateTexture.   The shared Direct3D 9 handle is then passed to OpenSharedResource in the hResource argument.The following code illustrates the method calls involved.<code>	
             sharedHandle = <c>null</c>; // must be set to <c>null</c> to create, can use a valid handle here to open in D3D9 	
            pDevice9-&gt;CreateTexture(..., pTex2D_9, &amp;sharedHandle); 	
            ... 	
            pDevice11-&gt;OpenSharedResource(sharedHandle, __uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource"/>), (void**)(&amp;tempResource11)); 	
            tempResource11-&gt;QueryInterface(__uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2D"/>), (void**)(&amp;pTex2D_11)); 	
            tempResource11-&gt;Release(); 	
            // now use pTex2D_11 with pDevice11    	
            </code>Textures being shared from D3D9 to D3D11 have the following restrictions.Textures must be 2D Only 1 mip level is allowed Texture must have default usage Texture must be write only MSAA textures are not allowed Bind flags must have SHADER_RESOURCE and RENDER_TARGET set Only R10G10B10A2_UNORM, R16G16B16A16_FLOAT and R8G8B8A8_UNORM formats are allowedIf a shared texture is updated on one device <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.Flush"/> must be called on that device.

            <remarks>	
            When multisampling a texture, the number of quality levels available for an adapter is dependent on the texture format used and the number of  samples requested. The maximum number of quality levels is defined by <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.MultisampleCountMaximum"/> in D3D11.h. If this method returns 0, the format  and sample count combination is not supported for the installed adapter.Furthermore, the definition of a quality level is up to each hardware vendor to define, however no facility is provided by Direct3D to help discover  this information.Note that FEATURE_LEVEL_10_1 devices are required to support 4x MSAA for all render targets except R32G32B32A32 and R32G32B32. FEATURE_LEVEL_11_0 devices are required to support 4x MSAA for all render target formats, and 8x MSAA for all render target formats  except R32G32B32A32 formats.

            The data stored in the device with this method can be retrieved with <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.GetPrivateData(System.Guid,System.Int32@,System.IntPtr)"/>.The data and guid set with this method will typically be application-defined.If an application uses this method to change the device type using GUID_DeviceType, results are undefined. However, GUID_DeviceType can be used to retrieve the device type using <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.GetPrivateData(System.Guid,System.Int32@,System.IntPtr)"/>.The debug layer reports memory leaks by outputting a list of object interface references along with their friendly names. The default friendly name is "&lt;unnamed&gt;". You can set the friendly name so that you can determine if the corresponding object interface reference caused the leak. To set the friendly name, use the SetPrivateData method and the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.CommonGuid.DebugObjectName"/> <see cref="T:System.Guid"/> that is in D3Dcommon.h. For example, to give pContext a friendly name of My name, use the following code:<code>	
             static const char c_szName[] = "My name";	
            hr = pContext-&gt;SetPrivateData( <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.CommonGuid.DebugObjectName"/>, sizeof( c_szName ) - 1, c_szName );

            <remarks>	
            Set an exception-mode flag to elevate an error condition to a non-continuable exception.Whenever an error occurs, a Direct3D device enters the DEVICEREMOVED state and if the appropriate exception flag has been set, an exception is raised. A raised exception is designed to terminate an application. Before termination, the last chance an application has to persist data is by using an UnhandledExceptionFilter (see Structured Exception Handling). In general, UnhandledExceptionFilters are leveraged to try to persist data when an application is crashing (to disk, for example). Any code that executes during an UnhandledExceptionFilter is not guaranteed to reliably execute (due to possible process corruption). Any data that the UnhandledExceptionFilter manages to persist, before the UnhandledExceptionFilter crashes again, should be treated as suspect, and therefore inspected by a new, non-corrupted process to see if it is usable.

            <param name="flags"><para>A combination of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.CreateDeviceContextStateFlags"/> values that are combined by using a bitwise OR operation. The resulting value specifies how to create the context state object. The <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.CreateDeviceContextStateFlags.Singlethreaded"/> flag is currently the only defined flag. If the original device was created with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceCreationFlags.SingleThreaded"/>, you must create all context state objects from that device with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.CreateDeviceContextStateFlags.Singlethreaded"/> flag. </para> <para>The context state object that  CreateDeviceContextState creates  inherits the threading model of its associated device context. By default the context state object is rent-threaded, so that an application synchronizes access to the device context, typically by use of critical sections. In contrast, the context state object is free-threaded if you used the ID3D10Multithread interface to turn on thread protection for the device context.</para> <para>If you set the single-threaded flag for both the context state object and the device, you guarantee that you will   call the whole set of context methods and device methods only from one thread. You therefore do not need to use critical sections to synchronize access to the device context, and the runtime can avoid working with those processor-intensive critical sections.</para></param>	
            <param name="featureLevelsRef"><para>A reference to an array of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel"/> values.

This is the first array value with which CreateDeviceContextState succeeded in creating the context state object. If the call to CreateDeviceContextState fails, the variable pointed to by pChosenFeatureLevel is set to zero.</para></param>	
            <returns>A <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContextState"/> object that represents the state of a Direct3D device.</returns>	
            <remarks>	
            The  REFIID value of the emulated interface is a <see cref="T:System.Guid"/> obtained by use of the __uuidof operator. For example, __uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device"/>) gets the <see cref="T:System.Guid"/> of the interface to a Microsoft Direct3D?11 device.Call the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext1.SwapDeviceContextState(SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContextState,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContextState@)"/> method to activate the context state object. When the context state object is active, the device behaviors that are associated with both the context state object's feature level and its compatible interface are activated on the Direct3D device until the next call to SwapDeviceContextState.When a context state object is active, the runtime disables certain methods on the device and context interfaces. For example, a context state object that is created with __uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device"/>) will cause the runtime to turn off most of the Microsoft Direct3D?10 device interfaces, and a context state object that is created with __uuidof(<see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device1"/>) or __uuidof(<see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device"/>) will cause the runtime to turn off most of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext"/> methods.	
            This behavior ensures that a user of either emulated interface cannot set device state that the other emulated interface is unable to express. This restriction helps guarantee that the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device1"/> emulated interface accurately reflects the full state of the pipeline and that the emulated interface will not operate contrary to its original interface definition.For example, suppose the tessellation stage is made active through the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext"/> interface	
            when you create the device through <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.D3D11.CreateDevice(SharpDX.DXGI.Adapter,SharpDX.Direct3D.DriverType,System.IntPtr,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceCreationFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel[],System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext@)"/> or D3D11CreateDeviceAndSwapChain,  instead of through the Direct3D?10 equivalents. Because  the Direct3D?11 context is active, a Direct3D?10 interface is inactive when you first retrieve it via QueryInterface. This means that you cannot  immediately pass a Direct3D?10 interface that you retrieved from a Direct3D?11 device to a function. You must first call SwapDeviceContextState to activate a Direct3D?10-compatible context state object.The following table shows the methods that are active and inactive for each emulated interface.Emulated interface Active device or immediate context  interfaces Inactive device or immediate context  interfaces  <para> <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device"/> or</para>

            <remarks>	
            The  REFIID value of the emulated interface is a <see cref="T:System.Guid"/> obtained by use of the __uuidof operator. For example, __uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device"/>) gets the <see cref="T:System.Guid"/> of the interface to a Microsoft Direct3D?11 device.Call the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext1.SwapDeviceContextState(SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContextState,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContextState@)"/> method to activate the context state object. When the context state object is active, the device behaviors that are associated with both the context state object's feature level and its compatible interface are activated on the Direct3D device until the next call to SwapDeviceContextState.When a context state object is active, the runtime disables certain methods on the device and context interfaces. For example, a context state object that is created with __uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device"/>) will cause the runtime to turn off most of the Microsoft Direct3D?10 device interfaces, and a context state object that is created with __uuidof(<see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device1"/>) or __uuidof(<see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device"/>) will cause the runtime to turn off most of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext"/> methods.	
            This behavior ensures that a user of either emulated interface cannot set device state that the other emulated interface is unable to express. This restriction helps guarantee that the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device1"/> emulated interface accurately reflects the full state of the pipeline and that the emulated interface will not operate contrary to its original interface definition.For example, suppose the tessellation stage is made active through the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext"/> interface	
            when you create the device through <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.D3D11.CreateDevice(SharpDX.DXGI.Adapter,SharpDX.Direct3D.DriverType,System.IntPtr,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceCreationFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel[],System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext@)"/> or D3D11CreateDeviceAndSwapChain,  instead of through the Direct3D?10 equivalents. Because  the Direct3D?11 context is active, a Direct3D?10 interface is inactive when you first retrieve it via QueryInterface. This means that you cannot  immediately pass a Direct3D?10 interface that you retrieved from a Direct3D?11 device to a function. You must first call SwapDeviceContextState to activate a Direct3D?10-compatible context state object.The following table shows the methods that are active and inactive for each emulated interface.Emulated interface Active device or immediate context  interfaces Inactive device or immediate context  interfaces  <para> <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device"/> or</para>

            The behavior of OpenSharedResource1 is similar to the behavior of the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.OpenSharedResource(System.IntPtr,System.Guid,System.IntPtr@)"/> method; each call to OpenSharedResource1 to access a resource creates a new resource object.  In other words, if you call OpenSharedResource1 twice and pass the same resource handle to hResource, you receive two resource  objects with different <see cref="T:SharpDX.ComObject"/> references.To share a resource between two devicesCreate the resource as shared and specify that it uses NT handles, by setting the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.SharedNthandle"/> flag. Obtain the REFIID, or <see cref="T:System.Guid"/>, of the interface to the resource by using the __uuidof() macro. For example, __uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2D"/>) retrieves the <see cref="T:System.Guid"/> of the interface to a 2D texture. Query the resource for the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Resource1"/> interface. Call the <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Resource1.CreateSharedHandle(System.String,SharpDX.DXGI.SharedResourceFlags,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Win32.SecurityAttributes})"/> method to obtain the unique handle to the resource.

            Copy the entire contents of the source resource to the destination resource using the GPU. 	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            This method is unusual in that it causes the GPU to perform the copy operation (similar to a memcpy by the CPU). As a result, it has a few restrictions designed for improving performance. For instance, the source and destination resources:  Must be different resources. Must be the same type. Must have identical dimensions (including width, height, depth, and size as appropriate). Will only be copied. CopyResource does not support any stretch, color key, blend, or format conversions. Must have compatible DXGI formats, which means the formats must be identical or at least from the same type group. For example, a DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_FLOAT texture can be copied to an DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_UINT texture since both of these formats are in the DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_TYPELESS group. Might not be currently mapped.  You cannot use an {{Immutable}} resource as a destination. You can use a   {{depth-stencil}} resource as either a source or a destination.  Resources created with multisampling capability (see <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SampleDescription"/>) can be used as source and destination only if both source and destination have identical multisampled count and quality. If source and destination differ in multisampled count and quality or if one is multisampled and the other is not multisampled the call to ID3D11DeviceContext::CopyResource fails. The method is an asynchronous call which may be added to the command-buffer queue. This attempts to remove pipeline stalls that may occur when copying data.  An application that only needs to copy a portion of the data in a resource should use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopySubresourceRegion_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceRegion})"/> instead.

            Copy a region from a source resource to a destination resource.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            The source box must be within the size of the source resource. The destination offsets, (x, y, and z) allow the source box to be offset when writing into the destination resource; however, the dimensions of the source box and the offsets must be within the size of the resource. If the resources are buffers, all coordinates are in bytes; if the resources are textures, all coordinates are in texels. {{D3D11CalcSubresource}} is a helper function for calculating subresource indexes. CopySubresourceRegion performs the copy on the GPU (similar to a memcpy by the CPU). As a consequence, the source and destination resources:  Must be different subresources (although they can be from the same resource). Must be the same type. Must have compatible DXGI formats (identical or from the same type group). For example, a DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_FLOAT texture can be copied to an DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_UINT texture since both of these formats are in the DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_TYPELESS group. May not be currently mapped.  CopySubresourceRegion only supports copy; it does not support any stretch, color key, blend, or format conversions. An application that needs to copy an entire resource should use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopyResource_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource)"/> instead. CopySubresourceRegion is an asynchronous call which may be added to the command-buffer queue, this attempts to remove pipeline stalls that may occur when copying data. See performance considerations for more details. Note??If you use CopySubresourceRegion with a depth-stencil buffer or a multisampled resource, you must copy the whole subresource. In this situation, you must pass 0 to the DstX, DstY, and DstZ parameters and NULL to the pSrcBox parameter. In addition, source and destination resources, which are represented by the pSrcResource and pDstResource parameters, should have identical sample count values. Example The following code snippet copies a box (located at (120,100),(200,220)) from a source texture into a reqion (10,20),(90,140) in a destination texture. 	
            <code> D3D11_BOX sourceRegion;	
            sourceRegion.left = 120;	
            sourceRegion.right = 200;	
            sourceRegion.top = 100;	
            sourceRegion.bottom = 220;	
            sourceRegion.front = 0;	
            sourceRegion.back = 1; pd3dDeviceContext-&gt;CopySubresourceRegion( pDestTexture, 0, 10, 20, 0, pSourceTexture, 0, &amp;sourceRegion ); </code>	
            	
             Notice, that for a 2D texture, front and back are set to 0 and 1 respectively.

            This API is most useful when re-using the resulting rendertarget of one render pass as an input to a second render pass. The source and destination resources must be the same resource type and have the same dimensions. In addition, they must have compatible formats. There are three scenarios for this:  ScenarioRequirements Source and destination are prestructured and typedBoth the source and destination must have identical formats and that format must be specified in the Format parameter. One resource is prestructured and typed and the other is prestructured and typelessThe typed resource must have a format that is compatible with the typeless resource (i.e. the typed resource is DXGI_FORMAT_R32_FLOAT and the typeless resource is DXGI_FORMAT_R32_TYPELESS). The format of the typed resource must be specified in the Format parameter. Source and destination are prestructured and typelessBoth the source and desintation must have the same typeless format (i.e. both must have DXGI_FORMAT_R32_TYPELESS), and the Format parameter must specify a format that is compatible with the source and destination (i.e. if both are DXGI_FORMAT_R32_TYPELESS then DXGI_FORMAT_R32_FLOAT could be specified in the Format parameter). For example, given the DXGI_FORMAT_R16G16B16A16_TYPELESS format:  The source (or dest) format could be DXGI_FORMAT_R16G16B16A16_UNORM The dest (or source) format could be DXGI_FORMAT_R16G16B16A16_FLOAT    ?

            Queries in a deferred context are limited to predicated drawing. That is, you cannot call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.GetDataInternal(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous,System.IntPtr,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.AsynchronousFlags)"/> on a deferred context to get data about a query; you can only call GetData on the immediate context to get data about a query. For predicated drawing, the results of a predication-type query are used by the GPU and not returned to an application.

            <remarks>	
            The predicate must be in the "issued" or "signaled" state to be used for predication. While the predicate is set for predication, calls to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.Begin(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous)"/> and <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.End(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous)"/> are invalid.This method is used to denote that subsequent rendering and resource manipulation commands are not actually performed if the resulting Predicate data of the Predicate is equal to the PredicateValue. However, some Predicates are only hints, so they may not actually prevent operations from being performed.The primary usefulness of Predication is to allow an application to issue graphics commands without taking the performance hit of spinning, waiting for <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.GetDataInternal(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous,System.IntPtr,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.AsynchronousFlags)"/> to return. So, Predication can occur while <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.GetDataInternal(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous,System.IntPtr,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.AsynchronousFlags)"/> returns S_FALSE. Another way to think of it: an application can also use Predication as a fallback, if it is possible that <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.GetDataInternal(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous,System.IntPtr,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.AsynchronousFlags)"/> returns S_FALSE. If <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.GetDataInternal(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous,System.IntPtr,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.AsynchronousFlags)"/> returns <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.Ok"/>, the application can skip calling the graphics commands manually with it's own application logic.

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            A draw API submits work to the rendering pipeline. This API submits work of an unknown size that was processed by the input assembler, vertex shader, and stream-output stages;  the work may or may not have gone through the geometry-shader stage.After data has been streamed out to stream-output stage buffers, those buffers can be again bound to the Input Assembler stage at input slot 0 and DrawAuto will draw them without the application needing to know the amount of data that was written to the buffers. A measurement of the amount of data written to the SO stage buffers is maintained internally when the data is streamed out. This means that the CPU does not need to fetch the measurement before re-binding the data that was streamed as input data. Although this amount is tracked internally, it is still the responsibility of applications to use input layouts to describe the format of the data in the SO stage buffers so that the layouts are available when the buffers are again bound to the input assembler.The following diagram shows the DrawAuto process.Calling DrawAuto does not change the state of the streaming-output buffers that were bound again as inputs.DrawAuto only works when drawing with one input buffer bound as an input to the IA stage at slot 0. Applications must create the SO buffer resource with both binding flags, <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.BindFlags.VertexBuffer"/> and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.BindFlags.StreamOutput"/>.This API does not support indexing or instancing.If an application needs to retrieve the size of the streaming-output buffer, it can query for statistics on streaming output by using <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.QueryType.StreamOutputStatistics"/>.

            <remarks>	
            The source box must be within the size of the source resource. The destination offsets, (x, y, and z) allow the source box to be offset when writing into the destination resource; however, the dimensions of the source box and the offsets must be within the size of the resource.If the resources are buffers, all coordinates are in bytes; if the resources are textures, all coordinates are in texels. D3D11CalcSubresource is a helper function for calculating subresource indexes.CopySubresourceRegion performs the copy on the GPU (similar to a memcpy by the CPU). As a consequence, the source and destination resources:Must be different subresources (although they can be from the same resource). Must be the same type. Must have compatible DXGI formats (identical or from the same type group). For example, a <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_Float"/> texture can be copied to an <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_UInt"/> texture since both of these formats are in the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_Typeless"/> group. May not be currently mapped.CopySubresourceRegion only supports copy; it does not support any stretch, color key, blend, or format conversions. An application that needs to copy an entire resource should use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopyResource_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource)"/> instead.CopySubresourceRegion is an asynchronous call, which may be added to the command-buffer queue, this attempts to remove pipeline stalls that may occur when copying data. For more information about pipeline stalls, see performance considerations.Note??If you use CopySubresourceRegion with a depth-stencil buffer or a multisampled resource, you must copy the whole subresource. In this situation, you must pass 0 to the DstX, DstY, and DstZ parameters and <c>null</c> to the pSrcBox parameter. In addition, source and destination resources, which are represented by the pSrcResource and pDstResource parameters, should have identical sample count values.ExampleThe following code snippet copies a box (located at (120,100),(200,220)) from a source texture into a reqion (10,20),(90,140) in a destination texture.<code>	
             <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceRegion"/> sourceRegion;	
            sourceRegion.left = 120;	
            sourceRegion.right = 200;	
            sourceRegion.top = 100;	
            sourceRegion.bottom = 220;

            This method is unusual in that it causes the GPU to perform the copy operation (similar to a memcpy by the CPU). As a result, it has a few restrictions designed for improving performance. For instance, the source and destination resources:Must be different resources. Must be the same type. Must have identical dimensions (including width, height, depth, and size as appropriate). Will only be copied. CopyResource does not support any stretch, color key, blend, or format conversions. Must have compatible DXGI formats, which means the formats must be identical or at least from the same type group. For example, a <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_Float"/> texture can be copied to an <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_UInt"/> texture since both of these formats are in the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_Typeless"/> group. Might not be currently mapped.You cannot use an Immutable resource as a destination. You can use a   depth-stencil resource as either a source or a destination.  Resources created with multisampling capability (see <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SampleDescription"/>) can be used as source and destination only if both source and destination have identical multisampled count and quality. If source and destination differ in multisampled count and quality or if one is multisampled and the other is not multisampled the call to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopyResource_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource)"/> fails.The method is an asynchronous call which may be added to the command-buffer queue. This attempts to remove pipeline stalls that may occur when copying data.An application that only needs to copy a portion of the data in a resource should use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopySubresourceRegion_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceRegion})"/> instead.

            For a shader-constant buffer; set pDstBox to <c>null</c>. It is not possible to use this method to partially update a shader-constant buffer.A resource cannot be used as a destination if:the resource is created with immutable or dynamic usage. the resource is created as a depth-stencil resource. the resource is created with multisampling capability (see <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SampleDescription"/>).When UpdateSubresource returns, the application is free to change or even free the data pointed to by pSrcData because the method has already copied/snapped away the original contents.The performance of UpdateSubresource depends on whether or not there is contention for the destination resource. For example, contention for a vertex buffer resource occurs when the application executes a Draw call and later calls UpdateSubresource on the same vertex buffer before the Draw call is actually executed by the GPU.When there is contention for the resource, UpdateSubresource will perform 2 copies of the source data. First, the data is copied by the CPU to a temporary storage space accessible by the command buffer. This copy happens before the method returns.  A second copy is then performed by the GPU to copy the source data into non-mappable memory. This second copy happens asynchronously because it is executed by GPU when the command buffer is flushed. When there is no resource contention, the behavior of UpdateSubresource is dependent on which is faster (from the CPU's perspective): copying the data to the command buffer and then having a second copy execute when the command buffer is flushed, or having the CPU copy the data to the final resource location. This is dependent on the architecture of the underlying system.To better understand the source row pitch and source depth pitch parameters, the following illustration shows a 3D volume texture.Each block in this visual represents an element of data, and the size of each element is dependent on the resource's format. For example, if the resource format is <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32A32_Float"/>, the size of each element would be 128 bits, or 16 bytes. This 3D volume texture has a width of two, a height of three, and a depth of four.To calculate the source row pitch and source depth pitch for a given resource, use the following formulas:Source Row Pitch = [size of one element in bytes] * [number of elements in one row] Source Depth Pitch = [Source Row Pitch] * [number of rows (height)]In the case of this example 3D volume texture where the size of each element is 16 bytes, the formulas are as follows:Source Row Pitch = 16 * 2 = 32 Source Depth Pitch = 16 * 2 * 3 = 96The following illustration shows the resource as it is laid out in memory.For example, the following code snippet shows how to specify a destination region in a 2D texture. Assume the destination texture is 512x512 and the operation will copy the data pointed to by pData to  [(120,100)..(200,220)] in the destination texture. Also assume that rowPitch has been initialized with the proper value (as explained above). front and back are set to 0 and 1 respectively, because by having front equal to back, the box is technically empty.<code>	
             <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceRegion"/> destRegion;	
            destRegion.left = 120;	
            destRegion.right = 200;	
            destRegion.top = 100;	
            destRegion.bottom = 220;	
            destRegion.front = 0;	
            destRegion.back = 1; pd3dDeviceContext-&gt;UpdateSubresource( pDestTexture, 0, &amp;destRegion, pData, rowPitch, 0 );	
            	
            </code>The 1D case is similar. The following snippet shows how to specify a destination region in a 1D texture. Use the same assumptions as above, except that the texture is 512 in length.<code>	
             <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceRegion"/> destRegion;	
            destRegion.left = 120	
            destRegion.right = 200;	
            destRegion.top = 0;	
            destRegion.bottom = 1;	
            destRegion.front = 0;	
            destRegion.back = 1; pd3dDeviceContext-&gt;UpdateSubresource( pDestTexture, 0, &amp;destRegion, pData, rowPitch, 0 );	
            	
            </code>Calling UpdateSubresource on a Deferred ContextIf your application calls UpdateSubresource on a deferred context with a destination box?to which pDstBox points?that has a non-(0,0,0) offset, and if the driver does not support command lists, UpdateSubresource inappropriately applies that destination-box offset to the pSrcData parameter. To work around this behavior, use the following code:<code>	
             <see cref="T:SharpDX.Result"/> UpdateSubresource_Workaround( <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device"/> *pDevice, <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext"/> *pDeviceContext, <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource"/> *pDstResource, UINT dstSubresource, const <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceRegion"/> *pDstBox, const void *pSrcData, UINT srcBytesPerElement, UINT srcRowPitch, UINT srcDepthPitch, bool* pDidWorkAround )	
            { <see cref="T:SharpDX.Result"/> hr = <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.Ok"/>; bool needWorkaround = false; <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContextType"/> contextType = pDeviceContext-&gt;GetType(); if( pDstBox &amp;&amp; (<see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContextType.Deferred"/> == contextType) ) { <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.FeatureDataThreading"/> threadingCaps = { <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/>, <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/> }; hr = pDevice-&gt;CheckFeatureSupport( <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Feature.Threading"/>, &amp;threadingCaps, sizeof(threadingCaps) ); if( SUCCEEDED(hr) ) { if( !threadingCaps.DriverCommandLists ) { needWorkaround = true; } } } const void* pAdjustedSrcData = pSrcData; if( needWorkaround ) { <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceRegion"/> alignedBox = *pDstBox; // convert from pixels to blocks if( m_bBC ) { alignedBox.left     /= 4; alignedBox.right    /= 4; alignedBox.top      /= 4; alignedBox.bottom   /= 4; } pAdjustedSrcData = ((const BYTE*)pSrcData) - (alignedBox.front * srcDepthPitch) - (alignedBox.top * srcRowPitch) - (alignedBox.left * srcBytesPerElement); } pDeviceContext-&gt;UpdateSubresource( pDstResource, dstSubresource, pDstBox, pAdjustedSrcData, srcRowPitch, srcDepthPitch ); if( pDidWorkAround ) { *pDidWorkAround = needWorkaround; } return hr;	
            }

            To use a resource with SetResourceMinLOD, you must set the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.ResourceClamp"/> flag when you create that resource.For Direct3D 10 and Direct3D 10.1, when sampling from a texture resource in a shader, the sampler can define a minimum LOD clamp to force sampling from less detailed mip levels.  For Direct3D 11, this functionality is extended from the sampler to the entire resource. Therefore, the application can specify the highest-resolution mip level of a resource that is available for access. This restricts the set of mip levels that are required to be resident in GPU memory, thereby saving memory.The set of mip levels resident per-resource in GPU memory can be specified by the user.Minimum LOD affects all of the resident mip levels. Therefore, only the resident mip levels can be updated and read from.All methods that access texture resources must adhere to minimum LOD clamps.Empty-set accesses are handled as out-of-bounds cases.

            <remarks>	
            Use this method to play back a command list that was recorded by a deferred context on any thread.This method performs some runtime validation related to queries. Queries that are begun in a device context cannot be manipulated indirectly by executing a command list (that is, Begin or End was invoked against the same query by the deferred context which generated the command list). If such a condition occurs, the ExecuteCommandList method does not execute the command list. However, the state of the device context is still maintained, as would be expected (<see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.ClearState"/> is performed, unless the application indicates to preserve the device context state).

            <summary>	
            Sends queued-up commands in the command buffer to the graphics processing unit (GPU).	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            Most applications don't need to call this method. If an application calls this method when not necessary, it incurs a performance penalty.  Each call to Flush incurs a significant amount of overhead.When Microsoft Direct3D state-setting, present, or draw commands are called by an application, those commands are queued into an internal command buffer.  Flush sends those commands to the GPU for processing. Typically, the Direct3D runtime sends these commands to the GPU automatically whenever the runtime determines that  they need to be sent, such as when the command buffer is full or when an application maps a resource. Flush sends the commands manually.We recommend that you use Flush when the CPU waits for an arbitrary amount of time (such as when  you call the Sleep function).Because Flush operates asynchronously,  it can return either before or after the GPU finishes executing the queued graphics commands. However, the graphics commands eventually always complete. You can call the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateQuery(SharpDX.Direct3D11.QueryDescription,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Query)"/> method with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.QueryType.Event"/> value to create an event query; you can then use that event query in a call to the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.GetDataInternal(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous,System.IntPtr,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.AsynchronousFlags)"/> method to determine when the GPU is finished processing the graphics commands.Microsoft Direct3D?11 defers the destruction of objects. Therefore, an application can't rely upon objects immediately being destroyed. By calling Flush, you destroy any  objects whose destruction was deferred.  If an application requires synchronous destruction of an object, we recommend that the application release all its references, call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.ClearState"/>, and then call Flush.Deferred Destruction Issues with Flip Presentation Swap ChainsDirect3D?11 defers the destruction of objects like views and resources until it can efficiently destroy them. This deferred destruction can cause problems with flip presentation model swap chains. Flip presentation model swap chains have the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapEffect.FlipSequential"/> flag set. When you create a flip presentation model swap chain, you can associate only one swap chain at a time with an <see cref="T:System.IntPtr"/>, IWindow, or composition surface. If an application attempts to destroy a flip presentation model swap chain and replace it with another swap chain, the original swap chain is not destroyed when the application immediately frees all of the original swap chain's references.Most applications typically use the <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.ResizeBuffers(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.Format,SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainFlags)"/> method for the majority of scenarios where they replace new swap chain buffers for old swap chain buffers. However, if an application must actually destroy an old swap chain and create a new swap chain, the application must force the destruction of all objects that the application freed. To force the destruction, call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.ClearState"/> (or otherwise ensure no views are bound to pipeline state), and then call Flush on the immediate context. You must force destruction before you call <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory2.CreateSwapChainForHwnd(SharpDX.ComObject,System.IntPtr,SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainDescription1@,System.Nullable{SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainFullscreenDescription},SharpDX.DXGI.Output)"/>, IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForImmersiveWindow, or IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForCompositionSurface again to create a new swap chain.

            Create a command list from a deferred context and record commands into it by calling FinishCommandList. Play back a command list with an immediate context by calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.ExecuteCommandList(SharpDX.Direct3D11.CommandList,System.Boolean)"/>.Immediate context state is cleared before and after a command list is executed. A command list has no concept of inheritance. Each call to FinishCommandList will record only the state set since any previous call to  FinishCommandList.For example, the state of a device context is its render state or pipeline state. To retrieve device context state, an application can call  <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.GetDataInternal(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous,System.IntPtr,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.AsynchronousFlags)"/> or  <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.GetPredication(System.Boolean@)"/>.For more information about how to use FinishCommandList, see How to: Record a Command List.

            <remarks>	
            If you call UpdateSubresource1 to update a constant buffer, pass any region, and the driver has not been implemented to Windows Developer Preview, the runtime drops the call (except feature level 9.1, 9.2, and 9.3 where the runtime emulates support).  The runtime also drops the call if you update a constant buffer with a partial region whose extent is not aligned to 16-byte granularity (16 bytes being a full constant). When the runtime drops the call, the runtime doesn't call the corresponding device driver interface (DDI).When you record a call to UpdateSubresource with an offset pDstBox in a software command list, the offset in pDstBox is incorrectly applied to pSrcData when you play back the command list.  The new-for-Windows Developer PreviewUpdateSubresource1 fixes this issue. In a call to UpdateSubresource1, pDstBox does not affect pSrcData.

            <remarks>	
            DiscardView informs the graphics processing unit (GPU) that the existing content in the resource view that pResourceView points to is no longer needed.  The view can be an SRV, RTV, UAV, or DSV.  DiscardView is a variation on the DiscardResource method.  DiscardView allows you to discard a subset of a resource that is in a view (such as a single miplevel).  More importantly, DiscardView provides a convenience because often views are what are being bound and unbound at the pipeline.  Some pipeline bindings do not have views, such as stream output.  In that situation, DiscardResource can do the job for any resource.

This feature is always available on new drivers for feature level 10 and higher.From the shader?s point of view, element [0] in the constant buffers array is the constant at pFirstConstant.Out of bounds access to the constant buffers from the shader to the range that is defined by pFirstConstant and pNumConstants returns 0.If pFirstConstant and pNumConstants arrays are <c>null</c>, you get the same result as if you were binding the entire buffer into view.  You get this same result if you call the GSSetConstantBuffers method. If the buffer is larger than the maximum constant buffer size that is supported by shaders (4096 elements), the shader can access only the first 4096 constants.If either pFirstConstant or pNumConstants is <c>null</c>, the other parameter must also be <c>null</c>.

            <remarks>	
            SwapDeviceContextState changes device behavior. This device behavior depends on the emulated interface that you passed to the EmulatedInterface parameter of the  <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device1.CreateDeviceContextState(SharpDX.Direct3D11.CreateDeviceContextStateFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel[],System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Guid,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContextState)"/> method when you created the context state object.SwapDeviceContextState disables the incompatible device interfaces <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device"/>, <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device1"/>, <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device"/>, and <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device1"/>. When a context state object is active, the runtime disables certain methods on the device and context interfaces. A context state object that is created with __uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device1"/>) or __uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device"/>) turns off most of the Direct3D?10 device interfaces. A context state object that is created with __uuidof(<see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device1"/>) or __uuidof(<see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device"/>) turns off most of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext"/> methods.	
            For more information about this behavior, see <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device1.CreateDeviceContextState(SharpDX.Direct3D11.CreateDeviceContextStateFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel[],System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Guid,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContextState)"/>.SwapDeviceContextState activates the context state object specified by pState. This means that the device behaviors that are associated with the context state object's feature level and compatible interface are activated on the Microsoft Direct3D device until the next call to SwapDeviceContextState. In addition, any state that was saved when this context state object was last active is now reactivated, so that the previous state is replaced.SwapDeviceContextState sets ppPreviousState to the most recently activated context state object. The object allows the caller to save and then later restore the previous device state. This behavior is useful in a plug-in architecture such as Direct2D that shares a Direct3D device with its plug-ins. A Direct2D interface can use context state objects to save and restore the application's state.If the caller did not previously call the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device1.CreateDeviceContextState(SharpDX.Direct3D11.CreateDeviceContextStateFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel[],System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Guid,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContextState)"/> method to create a previous context state object, SwapDeviceContextState sets ppPreviousState to the default context state object. In either case, usage of SwapDeviceContextState is the same.The feature level that is specified by the application, and that is chosen by the context state object from the acceptable list that the application supplies to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device1.CreateDeviceContextState(SharpDX.Direct3D11.CreateDeviceContextStateFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel[],System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Guid,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContextState)"/>, controls the feature level of the immediate context whenever the context state object is active. Because the Direct3D?11 device is free-threaded, the context state objects cannot assert the device's feature level. Instead, the device runs at a feature level that is the maximum of all previously created context state objects' feature levels. This means that the device's feature level can increase dynamically.The feature level of the context state object controls the functionality available from the immediate context. However, to maintain the free-threaded contract of the Direct3D?11 device methods?the resource-creation methods in particular?the upper-bound feature level of all created context state objects controls the set of resources that the device creates.Because the context state object interface is published by the immediate context, the interface requires the same threading model as the immediate context. Specifically, SwapDeviceContextState is single-threaded with respect to the other immediate context methods and with respect to the equivalent methods of <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device"/>.Crucially, because only one of the Direct3D?10 or Direct3D?11 ref-count behaviors can be available at a time, one of the Direct3D?10 and Direct3D?11 interfaces must break its ref-count contract. To avoid this situation, the activation of a context state object turns off the incompatible version interface. Also, if you call a method of an incompatible version interface, the call silently fails if the method has  return type void, returns an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Result"/> value of E_INVALIDARG, or sets any out parameter to <c>null</c>.When you switch from Direct3D?11 mode to either Direct3D?10 mode or Direct3D?10.1 mode, the binding behavior of the device changes. Specifically, the final release of a resource induces unbind in Direct3D?10 mode or Direct3D?10.1 mode. During final release an application releases all of the resource's references, including indirect references such as the linkage from view to resource, and the linkage from context state object to any of the context state object's bound resources. Any bound resource to which the application has no reference is unbound and destroyed, in order to maintain the Direct3D?10 behavior.SwapDeviceContextState does not affect any state that <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.VideoContext"/> sets.If deferred contexts activate context state objects, only one context can use a context state object at a time, a condition that SwapDeviceContextState verifies. SwapDeviceContextState causes a sync across all contexts.  Command lists that are generated by deferred contexts do not hold a reference to context state objects and are not affected by future updates to context state objects.No asynchronous objects are affected by SwapDeviceContextState. For example, if a query is active before a call to SwapDeviceContextState, it is still active after the call.

            <remarks>	
            ClearView works only on render-target views (RTVs), unordered-access views (UAVs), or any video view of a Texture2D surface. The runtime drops invalid calls.  ClearView applies the same color value to all array slices in the view. Each rectangle in the pRect array corresponds to each array slice.The runtime converts and clamps color values to the destination format as appropriate per Microsoft Direct3D conversion rules.  For example, if the format of the view is <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R8G8B8A8_UNorm"/>, the runtime clamps inputs to 0.0f to 1.0f (INF/NaN -&gt; 0).If the format is integer, such as <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R8G8B8A8_UInt"/>, the runtime interprets inputs as integral floats. Therefore, 235.0f maps to 235 (rounds to zero, out of range/INF values clamp to target range, and NaN to 0).Here are the color mappings:Color[0]: R (or Y for video) Color[1]: G (or U/Cb for video) Color[2]: B (or V/Cr for video) Color[3]: AFor video views with YUV or YCbBr formats, ClearView doesn't convert color values. In situations where the format name doesn?t indicate _UNORM,  _UINT, and so on, ClearView assumes _UINT. Therefore, 235.0f maps to 235 (rounds to zero, out of range/INF values clamp to target range, and NaN to 0).

            <remarks>	
            Call ID3D10Device::SOSetTargets (before any draw calls) to stream data out; call SOSetTargets with NULL to stop streaming data out. For an example, see Exercise 01 from the GDC 2007 workshop, which sets the stream output rendertargets before calling draw methods in the RenderInstanceToStream function. An offset of -1 will cause the stream output buffer to be appended, continuing after the last location written to the buffer in a previous stream output pass. Calling this method using a buffer that is currently bound for writing will effectively bind NULL instead because a buffer cannot be bound as both an input and an output at the same time. The {{Debug Layer}} will generate a warning whenever a resource is prevented from being bound simultaneously as an input and an output, but this will not prevent invalid data from being used by the runtime. The method will not hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. For that reason, applications should be careful not to release an interface currently in use by the device.

            <remarks>	
            An offset of -1 will cause the stream output buffer to be appended, continuing after the last location written to the buffer in a previous stream output pass.Calling this method using a buffer that is currently bound for writing will effectively bind <c>null</c> instead because a buffer cannot be bound as both an input and an output at the same time.The debug layer will generate a warning whenever a resource is prevented from being bound simultaneously as an input and an output, but this will not prevent invalid data from being used by the runtime.The method will hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. This differs from the device state behavior in Direct3D 10.

            The method will hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. This differs from the device state behavior in Direct3D 10.The Direct3D 11.1 runtime, which is available starting with Windows Developer Preview, can bind a larger number of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Buffer"/> resources to the shader than the maximum constant buffer size that is supported by shaders (4096 constants ? 4*32-bit components each).  When you bind such a large buffer, the shader can access only the first 4096 4*32-bit component constants in the buffer, as if 4096 constants is the full size of the buffer.If the application wants the shader to access other parts of the buffer, it must call the CSSetConstantBuffers1 method instead.

            <remarks>	
            Blend state is used by the output-merger stage to determine how to blend together two pixel values. The two values are commonly the current pixel value and the pixel value already in the output render target. Use the blend operation to control where the two pixel values come from and how they are mathematically combined.To create a blend-state interface, call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateBlendState(SharpDX.Direct3D11.BlendStateDescription@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.BlendState)"/>.Passing in <c>null</c> for the blend-state interface indicates to the runtime to set a default blending state.  The following table indicates the default blending parameters.StateDefault Value AlphaToCoverageEnableFALSE BlendEnableFALSE[8] SrcBlendD3D11_BLEND_ONE DstBlendD3D11_BLEND_ZERO BlendOpD3D11_BLEND_OP_ADD SrcBlendAlphaD3D11_BLEND_ONE DstBlendAlphaD3D11_BLEND_ZERO BlendOpAlphaD3D11_BLEND_OP_ADD RenderTargetWriteMask[8]<see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ColorWriteMaskFlags.All"/>[8]?A sample mask determines which samples get updated in all the active render targets. The mapping of bits in a sample mask to samples in a multisample render target is the responsibility of an individual application. A sample mask is always applied; it is independent of whether multisampling is enabled, and does not depend on whether an application uses multisample render targets.The method will hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. This differs from the device state behavior in Direct3D 10.

            <remarks>	
            The maximum number of active render targets a device can have active at any given time is set by a #define in D3D11.h called  D3D11_SIMULTANEOUS_RENDER_TARGET_COUNT. It is invalid to try to set the same subresource to multiple render target slots.  Any render targets not defined by this call are set to <c>null</c>.If any subresources are also currently bound for reading in a different stage or writing (perhaps in a different part of the pipeline),  those bind points will be set to <c>null</c>, in order to prevent the same subresource from being read and written simultaneously in a single rendering operation.The method will hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. This differs from the device state behavior in Direct3D 10.If the render-target views were created from an array resource type, then all of the render-target views must have the same array size.   This restriction also applies to the depth-stencil view, its array size must match that of the render-target views being bound.The pixel shader must be able to simultaneously render to at least eight separate render targets. All of these render targets must access the same type of resource: Buffer, Texture1D, Texture1DArray, Texture2D, Texture2DArray, Texture3D, or TextureCube. All render targets must have the same size in all dimensions (width and height, and depth for 3D or array size for *Array types). If render targets use multisample anti-aliasing, all bound render targets and depth buffer must be the same form of multisample resource (that is, the sample counts must be the same). Each render target can have a different data format. These render target formats are not required to have identical bit-per-element counts.Any combination of the eight slots for render targets can have a render target set or not set.The same resource view cannot be bound to multiple render target slots simultaneously. However, you can set multiple non-overlapping resource views of a single resource as simultaneous multiple render targets.

            <remarks>	
            Blend state is used by the output-merger stage to determine how to blend together two pixel values. The two values are commonly the current pixel value and the pixel value already in the output render target. Use the blend operation to control where the two pixel values come from and how they are mathematically combined.To create a blend-state interface, call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateBlendState(SharpDX.Direct3D11.BlendStateDescription@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.BlendState)"/>.Passing in <c>null</c> for the blend-state interface indicates to the runtime to set a default blending state.  The following table indicates the default blending parameters.StateDefault Value AlphaToCoverageEnableFALSE BlendEnableFALSE[8] SrcBlendD3D11_BLEND_ONE DstBlendD3D11_BLEND_ZERO BlendOpD3D11_BLEND_OP_ADD SrcBlendAlphaD3D11_BLEND_ONE DstBlendAlphaD3D11_BLEND_ZERO BlendOpAlphaD3D11_BLEND_OP_ADD RenderTargetWriteMask[8]<see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ColorWriteMaskFlags.All"/>[8]?A sample mask determines which samples get updated in all the active render targets. The mapping of bits in a sample mask to samples in a multisample render target is the responsibility of an individual application. A sample mask is always applied; it is independent of whether multisampling is enabled, and does not depend on whether an application uses multisample render targets.The method will hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. This differs from the device state behavior in Direct3D 10.

            Identifies how to bind a resource to the pipeline.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            In general, binding flags can be combined using a logical OR (except the constant-buffer flag); however, you should use a single flag to allow the device to optimize the resource usage.This enumeration is used by a:Buffer description when creating a buffer. Texture description when creating a texture (see <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture1DDescription"/> or <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2DDescription"/> or <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture3DDescription"/>).A shader-resource buffer is NOT a constant buffer; rather, it is a texture or buffer resource that is bound to a shader, that contains texture or buffer data (it is not limited to a single element type in the buffer). A shader-resource buffer is created with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.BindFlags.ShaderResource"/> flag and is bound to the pipeline using one of these APIs: <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.GeometryShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.IntPtr)"/>, <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.PixelShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.IntPtr)"/>, or <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.VertexShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.IntPtr)"/>. Furthermore, a shader-resource buffer cannot use the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteNoOverwrite"/> flag.

            The runtime implements RGB blending and alpha blending separately. Therefore, blend state requires separate blend operations for RGB data and alpha data. These blend operations are specified in a blend description. The two sources?Source 1, called SrcBlend and SrcBlendAlpha, and Source 2, called DestBlend and DestBlendAlpha?are shown in the blending block diagram.

            A comparison option determines whether how the runtime compares source (new) data against destination (existing) data before storing the new data. The comparison option is declared in a description before an object is created. The API allows you to set a comparison option for a depth-stencil buffer (see <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DepthStencilStateDescription"/>), depth-stencil operations (see <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DepthStencilOperationDescription"/>), or sampler state (see <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.SamplerStateDescription"/>).

For these cases, use <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceCreationFlags.PreventThreadingOptimizations"/> to request that the runtime and video driver not create any additional threads that might interfere with the application.

            <para>Forces the creation of the Direct3D device to fail if the display driver is not implemented to the WDDM for Windows Developer Preview (WDDM 1.2). When the display driver is not implemented to WDDM 1.2, only a Direct3D device that is created with feature level 9.1, 9.2, or 9.3 supports video; therefore, if this flag is set, the runtime creates the Direct3D device only for feature level 9.1, 9.2, or 9.3. We recommend not to specify this flag for applications that want to favor Direct3D capability over video. If feature level 10 and higher is available, the runtime will use that feature level regardless of video support.</para>	
             <para>If this flag is set, device creation on the Basic Render Device (BRD) will succeed regardless of the BRD's missing support for video decode. This is because the Media Foundation video stack operates in software mode on BRD. In this situation, if you force the video stack to create the Direct3D device twice (create the device once with this flag, next discover BRD, then again create the device without the flag), you actually degrade performance.</para>

            Identifies a resource to be accessed for reading and writing by the CPU. Applications may combine one or more of these flags.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            This enumeration is used in <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.MapSubresource(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture1D,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode,SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapFlags,SharpDX.DataStream@)"/>.These remarks are divided into the following topics:Meaning CommonMeaning of <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteNoOverwrite"/>D3D11_MAP_WRITE_NO_OVERWRITE signifies that the application promises not to write to data that the input assembler (IA) stage is using. In exchange, the GPU allows the application to write to other parts of the same buffer.  The application must ensure that it does not write over any data in use by the IA stage.For example, consider the buffer illustrated in the following diagram. If a Draw call has been issued that uses vertices 4-6, then an application that calls Map on this buffer must ensure that it does not write to the vertices that the Draw call will access during rendering.However, ensuring this can be difficult, because the GPU is often many frames behind the CPU in terms of which frame it is currently processing. Keeping track of which sections of a resource are being used because of calls made 2 to 5 frames ago is difficult and error-prone. Because of this, it is recommended that applications only write to the uninitialized portions of a resource when using <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteNoOverwrite"/>.Common Usage of <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteDiscard"/> with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteNoOverwrite"/>D3D11_MAP_WRITE_DISCARD and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteNoOverwrite"/> are normally used in conjunction with dynamic index/vertex buffers. <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteDiscard"/> can also be used with dynamic textures. However, <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteNoOverwrite"/> cannot be used with dynamic textures.A common use of these two flags involves filling dynamic index/vertex buffers with geometry that can be seen from the camera's current position. The first time that data is entered into the buffer on a given frame, Map is called with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteDiscard"/>; doing so invalidates the previous contents of the buffer. The buffer is then filled with all available data.Subsequent writes to the buffer within the same frame should use <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteNoOverwrite"/>. This will enable the CPU to access a resource that is potentially being used by the GPU as long as the restrictions described previously are respected.

              <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.SharedKeyedmutex"/> and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.GdiCompatible"/> are mutually exclusive. Therefore, do not use them together. <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.ResourceClamp"/> and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.GdiCompatible"/> are mutually exclusive. Therefore, do not use them together. You must bind the texture as a render target for the output-merger stage. For example, set the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.BindFlags.RenderTarget"/> flag in the BindFlags member of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2DDescription"/> structure. You must set the maximum number of MIP map levels to 1. For example, set the MipLevels member of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2DDescription"/> structure to 1. You must specify that the texture requires read and write access by the GPU. For example, set the Usage member of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2DDescription"/> structure to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Default"/>.  <para>You must set the texture format to one of the following types. </para>

             For example, set the Format member of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2DDescription"/> structure to one of these  types. You cannot use <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.GdiCompatible"/> with multisampling. Therefore, set the Count member of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SampleDescription"/> structure to 1. Then, set the SampleDesc member of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2DDescription"/> structure to this <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SampleDescription"/> structure.

            <remarks>	
            An application identifies the way a resource is intended to be used (its usage) in a resource description. There are several structures for creating resources including: <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture1DDescription"/>, <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2DDescription"/>, <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture3DDescription"/>, <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.BufferDescription"/>.<para>Differences between Direct3D 9 and Direct3D 10/11:</para>	
             <para>In Direct3D 9, you specify the type of memory a resource should be created in at resource creation time (using D3DPOOL). It was an application's job to decide what memory pool would provide the best combination of functionality and performance.</para>	
             <para>In Direct3D 10/11, an application no longer specifies what type of memory (the pool) to create a resource in. Instead, you specify the intended usage of the resource, and let the runtime (in concert with the driver and a memory manager) choose the type of memory that will achieve the best performance.</para>?Resource Usage RestrictionsEach usage dictates a tradeoff between accessibility for the CPU and accessibility for the GPU. In general, higher-performance access for one of these two processors means lower-performance access for the other. At either extreme are the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Default"/> and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Staging"/> usages. <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Default"/> restricts access almost entirely to the GPU. <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Staging"/> restricts access almost entirely to the CPU and allows only a data transfer (copy) of a resource between the GPU and the CPU. You can perform these copy operations via the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopySubresourceRegion_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceRegion})"/> and <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopyResource_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource)"/> methods. You can also use these copy methods to copy data between two resources of the same usage. You can also use the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.UpdateSubresource(SharpDX.DataBox,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32)"/> method to copy memory directly from a CPU-supplied reference to any resource, most usefully a resource with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Default"/>.D3D11_USAGE_DYNAMIC usage is a special case that optimizes the flow of data from CPU to GPU when the CPU generates that data on-the-fly and sends that data with high frequency. <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Dynamic"/> is typically used on resources with vertex data and on constant buffers. Use the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.MapSubresource(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture1D,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode,SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapFlags,SharpDX.DataStream@)"/> and <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.UnmapSubresource(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32)"/> methods to write data to these resources. To achieve the highest performance for data consumed serially, like vertex data, use the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteNoOverwrite"/> and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteDiscard"/> sequence. For more info about this sequence, see Common Usage of <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteDiscard"/> with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteNoOverwrite"/>.D3D11_USAGE_IMMUTABLE usage is another special case that causes the GPU to generate data just once when you create a resource. <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Immutable"/> is well-suited to data such as textures because such data is typically read into memory from some file format. Therefore, when you create a texture with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Immutable"/>, the GPU directly reads that texture into memory.Use the following table to choose the usage that best describes how the resource will need to be accessed by the CPU and/or the GPU. Of course, there will be performance tradeoffs.Resource UsageDefaultDynamicImmutableStaging GPU-Readyesyesyesyes1 GPU-Writeyesyes1 CPU-Readyes1 CPU-Writeyesyes1?1 - GPU read or write of a resource with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Staging"/> usage is restricted to copy operations. You use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopySubresourceRegion_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceRegion})"/> and <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopyResource_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource)"/> for these copy operations. Also, because depth-stencil formats and multisample layouts are implementation details of a particular GPU design, the operating system can?t expose these formats and layouts to the CPU in general. Therefore, staging resources can't be a depth-stencil buffer or a multisampled render target.Note??You can technically use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.UpdateSubresource(SharpDX.DataBox,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32)"/> to copy to a resource with any usage except <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Immutable"/>. However, we recommend to use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.UpdateSubresource(SharpDX.DataBox,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32)"/> to update only a resource with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Default"/>. We recommend to use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.MapSubresource(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture1D,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode,SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapFlags,SharpDX.DataStream@)"/> and <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.UnmapSubresource(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32)"/> to update resources with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Dynamic"/> because that is the specific purpose of <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Dynamic"/> resources, and is therefore the most optimized path.Note??<see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Dynamic"/> resources consume specific hardware capabilities. Therefore, use them sparingly. The display driver typically allocates memory for <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Dynamic"/> resources with a caching algorithm that favors CPU writes and hinders CPU reads. Furthermore, the memory behind <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Dynamic"/> resources might not even be the same for successive calls to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.MapSubresource(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture1D,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode,SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapFlags,SharpDX.DataStream@)"/>. Therefore, do not expect high performance or even consistent CPU reads from <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Dynamic"/> resources.Note??<see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopyStructureCount(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Buffer,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.UnorderedAccessView)"/> is a special case of GPU-to-CPU copy. Use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopyStructureCount(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Buffer,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.UnorderedAccessView)"/> only with unordered access views (UAVs) of buffers.Resource Bind OptionsTo maximize performance, not all resource usage options can be used as input or output resources to the pipeline. This table identifies these limitations.Resource Can Be Bound AsDefaultDynamicImmutableStaging Input to a Stageyes2yes3yes Output from a Stageyes2?2 - If bound as an input and an output using different views, each view must use different subresources. 3 - The resource can only be created with a single subresource. The resource cannot be a texture array. The resource cannot be a mipmap chain.

            The multiplier enables the filter range to have a fractional step value.For example, a hue filter might have an actual range of [?180.0 ... +180.0] with a step size of 0.25. The device would report the following range and multiplier:Minimum: ?720 Maximum: +720 Multiplier: 0.25In this case,  a filter value of 2 would be interpreted by the device as 0.50 (or 2 ? 0.25).The device should use  a multiplier that can be represented exactly as a base-2 fraction.

            <remarks>	
            These flags define video processing capabilities that usually are not needed, and that video devices are therefore not required to support.The first three flags relate to RGB support for functions that are normally applied to YCbCr video: deinterlacing, color adjustment, and luma keying. A device that supports these functions for YCbCr is not required  to support them for RGB input. Supporting RGB input for these functions  is  an additional capability, reflected by these constants. Note that the driver might convert the input to another color space, perform the indicated function, and then convert the result back to RGB.Similarly, a device that supports deinterlacing is not required to support deinterlacing of palettized formats. This capability is indicated by the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.VideoProcessorFormatCaps.PaletteInterlaced"/> flag.

            <remarks>	
            This enumeration designates the two stereo views as "frame 0" and "frame 1". The LeftViewFrame0 parameter of the VideoProcessorSetStreamStereoFormat method specifies which view is the left view, and which is the right view.For packed formats, if the source rectangle clips part of the surface, the driver interprets the rectangle in logical coordinates relative to the stereo view,  rather than absolute pixel coordinates. The result is that frame 0 and frame 1 are clipped proportionately.To query whether the device supports stereo 3D video, call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.VideoProcessorEnumerator.GetVideoProcessorCaps(SharpDX.Direct3D11.VideoProcessorCaps@)"/> and check for the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.VideoProcessorFeatureCaps.Stereo"/> flag in the FeatureCaps member of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.VideoProcessorCaps"/> structure. If this capability flag is present, it means that the driver supports all of the stereo formats that are not  listed as optional. To find out which optional formats are supported, call GetVideoProcessorCaps and check the StereoCaps member of the structure.

            This entry-point is supported by the Direct3D 11 runtime, which is available on Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, and as an update to  Windows Vista (KB971644).Set ppDevice and ppImmediateContext to <c>null</c> to determine which feature level is supported by looking  at pFeatureLevel without creating a device.For an example, see How To: Create a Device and Immediate Context; to create a device and a swap chain at the same time,  use D3D11CreateDeviceAndSwapChain.If you set the pAdapter parameter to a non-<c>null</c> value, you must also set the DriverType parameter to the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.DriverType.Unknown"/> value. If you set the pAdapter parameter to a non-<c>null</c> value and the DriverType parameter to the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.DriverType.Hardware"/> value, <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.D3D11.CreateDevice(SharpDX.DXGI.Adapter,SharpDX.Direct3D.DriverType,System.IntPtr,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceCreationFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel[],System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext@)"/> returns an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Result"/> of E_INVALIDARG.<para>Differences between Direct3D 10 and Direct3D 11:</para>	
             <para>In Direct3D 10, the presence of pAdapter dictated which adapter to use and the DriverType could  mismatch what the adapter was.</para>	
             <para>In Direct3D 11, if you are trying to create a hardware or a software device, set pAdapter != <c>null</c> which constrains  the other inputs to be:</para>	
              DriverType must be <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.DriverType.Unknown"/> Software must be <c>null</c>.  <para>On the other hand, if pAdapter == <c>null</c>, the DriverType cannot be set to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.DriverType.Unknown"/>; it can be set to either:</para>	
              If DriverType == <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.DriverType.Software"/>,  Software cannot be <c>null</c>. If DriverType == <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.DriverType.Hardware"/>, the adapter used will be the default adapter, which is the first adapter that is enumerated by IDXGIFactory1::EnumAdapters?

            The method will hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. This differs from the device state behavior in Direct3D 10.The Direct3D 11.1 runtime, which is available starting with Windows Developer Preview, can bind a larger number of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Buffer"/> resources to the shader than the maximum constant buffer size that is supported by shaders (4096 constants ? 4*32-bit components each).  When you bind such a large buffer, the shader can access only the first 4096 4*32-bit component constants in the buffer, as if 4096 constants is the full size of the buffer.If the application wants the shader to access other parts of the buffer, it must call the DSSetConstantBuffers1 method instead.

            <remarks>	
            The method will hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. This differs from the device state behavior in Direct3D 10.You can't use the <see cref="!:SharpDX.D3DCompiler.ConstantBuffer"/> interface to get information about what is currently bound to the pipeline in the device context. But you can use <see cref="!:SharpDX.D3DCompiler.ConstantBuffer"/> to get information from a compiled shader. For example, you can use <see cref="!:SharpDX.D3DCompiler.ConstantBuffer"/> and <see cref="!:SharpDX.D3DCompiler.ShaderReflectionVariable"/> to determine the slot in which a geometry shader expects a constant buffer. You can then pass this slot number to GSSetConstantBuffers to set the constant buffer. You can call the D3D11Reflect function to retrieve the address of a reference to the <see cref="!:SharpDX.D3DCompiler.ShaderReflection"/> interface and then call <see cref="!:SharpDX.D3DCompiler.ShaderReflection.GetConstantBuffer"/> to get a reference to <see cref="!:SharpDX.D3DCompiler.ConstantBuffer"/>.The Direct3D 11.1 runtime, which is available starting with Windows Developer Preview, can bind a larger number of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Buffer"/> resources to the shader than the maximum constant buffer size that is supported by shaders (4096 constants ? 4*32-bit components each).  When you bind such a large buffer, the shader can access only the first 4096 4*32-bit component constants in the buffer, as if 4096 constants is the full size of the buffer.If the application wants the shader to access other parts of the buffer, it must call the GSSetConstantBuffers1 method instead.

            The method will hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. This differs from the device state behavior in Direct3D 10.The Direct3D 11.1 runtime, which is available starting with Windows Developer Preview, can bind a larger number of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Buffer"/> resources to the shader than the maximum constant buffer size that is supported by shaders (4096 constants ? 4*32-bit components each).  When you bind such a large buffer, the shader can access only the first 4096 4*32-bit component constants in the buffer, as if 4096 constants is the full size of the buffer.If the application wants the shader to access other parts of the buffer, it must call the HSSetConstantBuffers1 method instead.

            The method will hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. This differs from the device state behavior in Direct3D 10.The Direct3D 11.1 runtime, which is available on Windows Developer Preview and later operating systems, can bind a larger number of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Buffer"/> resources to the shader than the maximum constant buffer size that is supported by shaders (4096 constants ? 4*32-bit components each).  When you bind such a large buffer, the shader can access only the first 4096 4*32-bit component constants in the buffer, as if 4096 constants is the full size of the buffer.If the application wants the shader to access other parts of the buffer, it must call the PSSetConstantBuffers1 method instead.

            The method will hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. This differs from the device state behavior in Direct3D 10.The Direct3D 11.1 runtime, which is available starting with Windows Developer Preview, can bind a larger number of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Buffer"/> resources to the shader than the maximum constant buffer size that is supported by shaders (4096 constants ? 4*32-bit components each).  When you bind such a large buffer, the shader can access only the first 4096 4*32-bit component constants in the buffer, as if 4096 constants is the full size of the buffer.If the application wants the shader to access other parts of the buffer, it must call the VSSetConstantBuffers1 method instead.

            Downsampling is sometimes used to reduce the quality of premium content when other forms of content protection are not available. By default, downsampling is disabled.If the Enable parameter is TRUE, the driver downsamples the composed image  to the specified size, and then scales it back to the size of the target rectangle.The width and height of Size must be greater than zero. If the size is larger than the target rectangle, downsampling does not occur.To use this feature, the driver must support downsampling, indicated by the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.VideoProcessorFeatureCaps.Constriction"/> capability flag. To query for this capability, call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.VideoProcessorEnumerator.GetVideoProcessorCaps(SharpDX.Direct3D11.VideoProcessorCaps@)"/>.

            Alpha blending is disabled by default.For each pixel, the destination color value is computed as follows:Cd = Cs * (As * Ap * Ae) + Cd * (1.0 - As * Ap * Ae)where:Cd = The color value of the destination pixel Cs = The color value of the source pixel As = The per-pixel source alpha Ap = The planar alpha value Ae = The palette-entry alpha value, or 1.0 (see Note)Note??Palette-entry alpha values apply only to palettized color formats, and only when the device supports the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.VideoProcessorFeatureCaps.AlphaPalette"/> capability. Otherwise, this factor equals 1.0.The destination alpha value is computed according to the alpha fill mode.

            <remarks>	
            This method applies only to  input streams that have a palettized color format. Palettized formats with 4 bits per pixel (bpp) use the first 16 entries in the list. Formats with 8 bpp use the first 256 entries.If a pixel has a palette index greater than the number of entries, the device treats the pixel as white with opaque alpha. For full-range RGB, this value is (255, 255, 255, 255); for YCbCr the value is (255, 235, 128, 128).If the driver does not report the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.VideoProcessorFeatureCaps.AlphaPalette"/> capability flag, every palette entry must have an alpha value of 0xFF (opaque). To query for this capability, call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.VideoProcessorEnumerator.GetVideoProcessorCaps(SharpDX.Direct3D11.VideoProcessorCaps@)"/>.

The StartSessionKeyRefresh method gets a random number from the driver, which is used to create a new session key. The new session key does not become active until the application calls FinishSessionKeyRefresh. After the application calls FinishSessionKeyRefresh, all protected surfaces are encrypted using the new session key.

This reflects the limitation in hardware that you can't mix logic operations with blending across multiple render targets, and that when you use a logic operation, you must apply the same logic operation to all render targets.

Target-independent rasterization, which enables you  to set the ForcedSampleCount member of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.RasterizerDescription1"/> to 1, 4, 8, or 16 and to render to RTVs with a single sample. UAV-only rendering with the ForcedSampleCount member of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.RasterizerDescription1"/> set to up to 16 (only up to 8 for feature level 11).The runtime always sets the following groupings of members identically. That is, all the values in a grouping are TRUE or <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/> together:DiscardAPIsSeenByDriver and FlagsForUpdateAndCopySeenByDriver ClearView, CopyWithOverlap, ConstantBufferPartialUpdate, ConstantBufferOffsetting, and MapNoOverwriteOnDynamicConstantBuffer MapNoOverwriteOnDynamicBufferSRV and MultisampleRTVWithForcedSampleCountOne

However, when z clipping is disabled, stencil shadow implementations are simplified. In other words, you can avoid complex special-case handling for geometry that goes beyond the back clipping plane.

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            The following diagram shows a 3D box, where the origin is the left, front, top corner.The values for right, bottom, and back are each one pixel past the end of the pixels that are included in the box region.  That is, the values for left, top, and front are included in the box region while the values for right, bottom, and back are excluded from the box region. For example, for a box that is one pixel wide, (right - left) == 1; the box region includes the left pixel but not the right pixel.

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            A view is a format-specific way to look at the data in a resource. The view determines what data to look at, and how it is cast when read.When viewing a resource, the resource-view description must specify a typed format, that is compatible with the resource format. So that means that you cannot create a resource-view description using any format with _TYPELESS in the name. You can however view a typeless resource by specifying a typed format for the view. For example, a <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_Typeless"/> resource can be viewed with one of these typed formats: <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_Float"/>, <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_UInt"/>, and <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_SInt"/>, since these typed formats are compatible with the typeless resource.Create a shader-resource-view description by calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateShaderResourceView(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceViewDescription},SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceView)"/>. To view a shader-resource-view description, call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceView.GetDescription(SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceViewDescription@)"/>.

            This structure is used in a call to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateTexture1D(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture1DDescription@,SharpDX.DataBox[],SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture1D)"/>. A helpful derived structure CD3D11_TEXTURE1D_DESC is declared in D3D11.h, to help create a texture description.The texture size range is determined by the feature level at which you create the device and not the Microsoft Direct3D interface version. For example, if you use Microsoft Direct3D?10 hardware at feature level 10 (<see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel.Level_10_0"/>) and call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.D3D11.CreateDevice(SharpDX.DXGI.Adapter,SharpDX.Direct3D.DriverType,System.IntPtr,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceCreationFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel[],System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext@)"/> to create an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device"/>, you must constrain the maximum texture size to <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Resource.MaximumTexture1DSize"/> (8192) when you create your 1D texture.

            This structure is used in a call to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateTexture2D(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2DDescription@,SharpDX.DataBox[],SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2D)"/>. A helpful derived structure CD3D11_TEXTURE2D_DESC is declared in D3D11.h, to help create a texture description.The device places some size restrictions (must be multiples of a minimum size) for a subsampled, block compressed, or bit-format resource.The texture size range is determined by the feature level at which you create the device and not the Microsoft Direct3D interface version. For example, if you use Microsoft Direct3D?10 hardware at feature level 10 (<see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel.Level_10_0"/>) and call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.D3D11.CreateDevice(SharpDX.DXGI.Adapter,SharpDX.Direct3D.DriverType,System.IntPtr,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceCreationFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel[],System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext@)"/> to create an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device"/>, you must constrain the maximum texture size to <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Resource.MaximumTexture2DSize"/> (8192) when you create your 2D texture.

            Values have a nominal range of [0...1]. Given a format with  n bits per channel, the value of each color component is calculated as follows:val = f * ((1 &lt;&lt; n)-1)For example, for 8-bit YUV formats, val = BYTE(f * 255.0).  Reference black is (0.0625, 0.5, 0.5), which corresponds to (16, 128, 128) in an 8-bit representation.

            The RGB_Range member applies to RGB output, while the YCbCr_Matrix and YCbCr_xvYCC members apply to YCbCr output. If the driver performs color-space conversion on the background color, it uses the values that apply to both color spaces.If the driver supports extended YCbCr (xvYCC), it returns the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.VideoProcessorDeviceCaps.XvYCC"/> capabilities flag in the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.VideoProcessorEnumerator.GetVideoProcessorCaps(SharpDX.Direct3D11.VideoProcessorCaps@)"/> method. Otherwise, the driver ignores the value of YCbCr_xvYCC and treats all YCbCr output as conventional YCbCr.If extended YCbCr is supported, it can be used with either transfer matrix. Extended YCbCr does not change the black point or white point?the black point is still 16 and the white point is still 235. However, extended YCbCr explicitly allows blacker-than-black values in the range 1?15, and whiter-than-white values in the range 236?254. When extended YCbCr is used, the driver should not clip the luma values to the nominal 16?235 range.

            The multiplier enables the filter range to have a fractional step value.For example, a hue filter might have an actual range of [?180.0 ... +180.0] with a step size of 0.25. The device would report the following range and multiplier:Minimum: ?720 Maximum: +720 Multiplier: 0.25In this case,  a filter value of 2 would be interpreted by the device as 0.50 (or 2 ? 0.25).The device should use  a multiplier that can be represented exactly as a base-2 fraction.
