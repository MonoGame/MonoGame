## Overview
**MonoGame** is a simple and powerful .NET framework for creating games for desktop PCs, video game consoles, and mobile devices using the C# programming language. It has been successfully used to create games such as [Streets of Rage 4](https://store.steampowered.com/app/985890/Streets_of_Rage_4/), [Carrion](https://store.steampowered.com/app/953490/CARRION/), [Celeste](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/), [Stardew Valley](https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/), and [many others](https://monogame.net/showcase/). 

It is an open-source re-implementation of the discontinued [Microsoft's XNA Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb200104.aspx).
