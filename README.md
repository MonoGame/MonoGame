# [MonoGame](http://monogame.net/) [![Build Status](http://teamcity.monogame.net/app/rest/builds/buildType:MonoGame_DevelopWin/statusIcon)](http://teamcity.monogame.net/project.html?projectId=MonoGame&guest=1)

[MonoGame](http://monogame.net) is an open source implementation of the Microsoft XNA 4.x Framework. 

Our goal is to make it easy for XNA developers to create cross-platform games with extremely high code reuse.

## Supported Platforms

* iOS (including Retina displays)
* Android
* Windows (OpenGL & DirectX)
* Mac OS X
* Linux
* [Windows Store Apps](http://dev.windows.com) (for Windows 8 and Windows RT)
* [Windows Phone 8](http://dev.windowsphone.com)
* [PlayStation Mobile](https://psm.playstation.net/portal/en/index.html) (currently 2D only)
* [OUYA](http://ouya.tv), an Android-based gaming console

## Quick Start

There are a few pre-requisites that you should be aware of for the various platforms. Please check them over [MonoGame](http://monogame.net/downloads) website.

There are four quick start options available:
* Download the current stable release from [our website](http://monogame.net/downloads).
* Download the latest "unstable" installer from [our build server](http://teamcity.monogame.net/viewLog.html?buildTypeId=MonoGame_DevelopWin&buildId=lastSuccessful&tab=artifacts&buildBranch=%3Cdefault%3E&guest=1).
* Download the latest [source code](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/archive/develop.zip).
* Fork and clone the repo: `https://github.com/mono/MonoGame.git`.

### Solutions & Projects

The solution and project files are generated by [Protobuild](https://github.com/hach-que/Protobuild) when you double-click `Protobuild.exe` on Windows or run `mono Protobuild.exe` under Mac OS or Linux.  To modify the projects you must edit the .definition file in the `Build/Projects/` folder and re-execute Protobuild.

For more information and advanced usage, please refer to the [Protobuild wiki](https://github.com/hach-que/Protobuild/wiki).

### Samples

Once you have MonoGame, grab the [MonoGame StarterKits](https://github.com/kungfubanana/MonoGame-StarterKits) or [MonoGame Samples](https://github.com/Mono-Game/MonoGame.Samples) to help get you started on your first project.

## Current Roadmap

* The MonoGame 2.x series is now in maintenance mode.
* MonoGame 3.0 will mark the start of full support for the entire XNA API.
* The Content Pipeline is currently under development. This will allow compiling of assets to optimized formats for the MonoGame supported platforms in Visual Studio or MonoDevelop without requiring XNA Game Studio 4.0 installed.
* SuperGiant Games have a version working in Google Chrome Native Client which we will merge back into our tree.
* Raspberry Pi has been shown to be working, but still needs some work.
