# MonoGame

MonoGame is a simple and powerful .NET framework for creating games for desktop PCs, video game consoles, and mobile devices using the C# programming language. It has been succesfully used to create games such as [Streets of Rage 4](https://store.steampowered.com/app/985890/Streets_of_Rage_4/), [Carrion](https://store.steampowered.com/app/953490/CARRION/), [Celeste](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/), [Stardew Valley](https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/), and [many others](https://www.monogame.net/showcase/).

It is an open-source re-implementation of the discontinued [Microsoft's XNA Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb200104.aspx).

## Build Status

We use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/actions) to automate builds and packages distribution of the latest MonoGame changes. We also rely on a [build server](http://teamcity.monogame.net/?guest=1) to run tests in order to avoid regressions.  The table below shows the current build status for the ```develop``` branch.
