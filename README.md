# WHAT IS MONOGAME
MonoGame is an OpenSource, OpenGL implementation of Microsoft's XNA 4 APIs that allows developers to build games that run on Android, iPhone, iPad, MacOS, Linux and soon PlayStation Suite and Windows Metro, all reusing their existing XNA code that runs on Xbox 360 or Windows Phone 7.

Here are some quotes from people how have played it already....

    Looks great, very smooth, very complete. 5/5
    
    Wow, this is fantastic. I just finished flying from KLAZ-KSAN and it was amazing. I am really excited for A321,CRJ and all the other planes. X plane has been deleted :)))  5/5
    
    This simulator is fantastic!!!! Best yet!! Looking forward to more planes and cockpits :) 5/5

This is MonoGame's first 3D game and we are very grateful that [Inflight Dev Studio](http://flyingdevstudio.blogspot.co.uk) donated their changes back to our codebase, thus speeding up our 3D implementation immeasurably.

This game has won [numerous awards](http://supergiantgames.com/?p=1286) for its narration and music, when it was released on XBox 360,
The development team used a modified MonoGame engine to port their game to Google's Native Client and therefore onto Google App Store.
We are hoping to find out what mods they made to MonoGame and how others could submit their games to Google's App Store.

This is what players had to say about the Google Chrome version of the game...

    I finished the game, it was amazing! A beautiful game with excellent graphic and very interesting story, the voice of the narrator makes a good ambiance in the game 5/5    
    
    I've played through this game twice. It's a little laggy on chrome, but this is one of the best games of 2011. It stands toe to toe with Portal 2 and Skyrim. It's that good. 5/5
    
    This game is amazing. The post-apocalyptic scenario, the easy-to-use controls, and well, smashing things. It can be really hard sometimes (specially if you are using idols), and you've got to be quick and train at least a little with each weapon to get how to use it properly. They deserved my $15. 5/5

# ROADMAP
    The 3.x series will extend MonoGame with support for the XNA 4 3D APIs.
    After 3.x is released work will begin on support for Sony PlayStation Suite SDK and Windows 8/WinRT

# HOW YOU CAN HELP

Firstly, go over to github and register. Then fork the main repo found at https://github.com/mono/MonoGame
This will allow you to make changes to your own repo and send us patches and enhancements, thus benefiting everyone.
Once you've done a *git clone [your forked repo]*, if you are interested in the associated sub-modules like Samples and Starterkits, you will need to execute the *git submodule init* and *git submodule update* commands, to pull them all down.

You can also join the active community of developers on IRC at irc.gnome.org on the #monogame channel, where the day-to-day improvements are being discussed in real time.
If you release a game using MonoGame, please let us know so we can update our released games page, and mention MonoGame in your tweet.
