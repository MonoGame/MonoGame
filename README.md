# MonoGame

MonoGame is a free OpenGL implementation of the XNA Framework. It is built upon the most excellent range of Mono compilers and it compatible with MonoTouch(iOS), MonoDroid(Android), MonoMac (Mac OS X) &amp; now Mono for Windows. Our goal is to allow XNA developers on Windows &amp; Windows Phone 7 to port of their games to the iOS / Android / Mac OS X / Windows and visa versa, with minimal hassle.<img src="https://github.com/downloads/technomancy/leiningen/leiningen-banner.png" alt="Leiningen logo" title="The man himself" align="right" />
