# MonoGame Goes Multi-Plaform : MonoGame 2.0 Released

MonoGame is an open source implementation of the XNA APIs that allows developers to build 2D games that run on Android, iPhone, iPad, Mac, Linux and Windows using the same code base, or reusing existing XNA code that runs on Xbox 360 or Windows Phone 7.

MonoGame 2.0 release is a major evolution of the platform. We went from only supporting the iPhone to becoming a cross-platform stack that now also runs on Android, Mac, Linux and Windows. To help developers get started, more than twenty individual samples and more than five complete starter kits are shipped with this release.

On the iOS platform, MonoGame runs on top of MonoTouch and there are at least eighteen games published on Appleâ€™s AppStore built using the technology. This new release opens the doors for developers to publish games to the Mac AppStore using MonoMac, to Android Market using Mono for Android, and also to Windows and Linux systems using Mono.

This major advance in the MonoGame platform was made possible by an exponential growth in the number of contributors to the project in the last seven months.   New contributors took over major components of the stack, tuned the performance, added new platforms, tuned the engine and fixed hundreds of bugs to turn MonoGame into a solid 2D gaming platform.

A new networking stack allows players on the same network to play with each other.   One player could be running the iOS client, while another one might be using a Mac and another one an Android device. All playing the same game.
