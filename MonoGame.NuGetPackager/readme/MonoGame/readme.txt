The goal is to make it easy for XNA developers to create cross-platform games with extremely high code reuse. We currently support iOS, Android, Windows (both OpenGL and DirectX), Mac OS X, Linux, Windows 8 Store, Windows Phone 8, PlayStation Mobile, and the OUYA console.

_Contents
This package contains the project templates for MonoGame projects for the currently supported platforms
Just create an empty solution for your target platform and install this package and you will have a complete starter solution.

This package replicates what the MonoGame project templates do without the need to install the MonoGame main installer.

_Install Instructions
Just apply this NuGet to your solution and all relevant project files will be installed.  
When asked, simply overwrite any files (if unsure, create a blank solution and compare files)

This package also installs the latest dependant MonoGame.Binaries NuGet package

_Release Notes
3.2.2 release in-line with the recent full 3.2 release and post updates

_Known Issues
The Binaries package currently supports more platforms than this template package.
